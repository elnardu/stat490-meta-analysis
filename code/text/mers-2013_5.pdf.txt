a bs t r ac t
background

in september 2012, the world health organization reported the first cases of pneumonia caused by the novel middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (merscov). we describe a cluster of health care–acquired mers-cov infections.
methods

medical records were reviewed for clinical and demographic information and determination of potential contacts and exposures. case patients and contacts were interviewed. the incubation period and serial interval (the time between the successive onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission) were estimated. viral rna was
sequenced.
results

between april 1 and may 23, 2013, a total of 23 cases of mers-cov infection were
reported in the eastern province of saudi arabia. symptoms included fever in 20 patients (87%), cough in 20 (87%), shortness of breath in 11 (48%), and gastrointestinal symptoms in 8 (35%); 20 patients (87%) presented with abnormal chest radiographs. as of june 12, a total of 15 patients (65%) had died, 6 (26%) had recovered,
and 2 (9%) remained hospitalized. the median incubation period was 5.2 days
(95% confidence interval [ci], 1.9 to 14.7), and the serial interval was 7.6 days (95%
ci, 2.5 to 23.1). a total of 21 of the 23 cases were acquired by person-to-person
transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units, or in-patient units in three
different health care facilities. sequencing data from four isolates revealed a single
monophyletic clade. among 217 household contacts and more than 200 health care
worker contacts whom we identified, mers-cov infection developed in 5 family
members (3 with laboratory-confirmed cases) and in 2 health care workers (both
with laboratory-confirmed cases).
conclusions

person-to-person transmission of mers-cov can occur in health care settings and
may be associated with considerable morbidity. surveillance and infection-control
measures are critical to a global public health response.

espiratory viruses are an emerging
threat to global health security and have
led to worldwide epidemics with substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) pandemic in 2003–2004,1-3 two
additional human coronaviruses — hku-1 and
nl-63 — have been identified, both of which
cause mild respiratory infection and are distributed worldwide.4,5 in september 2012, the world
health organization (who) reported two cases
of severe community-acquired pneumonia caused
by a novel human β-coronavirus, subsequently
named the middle east respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (mers-cov).6-8 since then, merscov has been identified as the cause of pneumonia in patients in saudi arabia,7,9 qatar,7,10 jordan,11,12 the united kingdom,13,14 germany,15
france,16 tunisia,17 and italy.17 phylogenetic analysis shows that the mers-cov defines a novel
lineage c, making this coronavirus a lineage c
β-coronavirus known to infect humans.18,19
the natural host and reservoir of mers-cov
remain unknown. we describe human-to-human
transmission of mers-cov in a health care setting, estimate the incubation period and serial interval (the time between the successive onset of
symptoms in a chain of transmission), and describe the clinical features of the disease.

me thods
setting

the governorate of al-hasa, in eastern saudi
arabia, serves a mixed urban and rural population
of 1.1 million persons. hospital a is a 150-bed
general hospital in the largest urban area (alhufuf). the dialysis unit, which cares for 43 patients in two shifts per day, is an open unit with
16 beds spaced 1.3 to 1.5 m apart. the intensive
care unit (icu) contains two open 6-bed bays.
hospitals b and c are also general hospitals in
al-hufuf. hospital d is a regional referral hospital located 160 km from al-hufuf.
definitions

a person was considered to have a confirmed
case of mers-cov infection if there was laboratory evidence of mers-cov and the person had
either fever and at least one respiratory symptom
or two respiratory symptoms without another
identifiable cause. a person was considered to
408

n engl j med 369;5

of

m e dic i n e

have a probable case of mers-cov infection if he
or she was a household, family, or health care
contact of a person with a confirmed case and if
pneumonia developed without another confirmed cause and either laboratory testing for
mers-cov was not performed or a single test
was negative and no other specimens were available for testing. the date of onset was defined
among febrile patients as the first day of fever
that persisted for more than 48 hours and among
afebrile patients as the first day of new cough or
shortness of breath. a person was considered to
have been exposed if he or she had had any faceto-face contact with a symptomatic patient who
had a confirmed or probable case, was in the
same hospital room or ward as a symptomatic
case patient for more than 1 hour, moved into a
bed vacated by a symptomatic case patient, was
being cared for by a health care worker who was
also caring for a symptomatic case patient, or
was sharing hospital equipment with a symptomatic case patient.
laboratory surveillance

beginning in september 2012, the saudi arabian
ministry of health requested that all patients
with pneumonia requiring admission to the icu
be tested for mers-cov. throat-swab (eurotubo,
deltalab), sputum, tracheal-aspirate, or broncho­
alveolar-lavage specimens were obtained and
were placed in viral transport medium (vircell),
stored at 28°c, and transported within 72 hours
to the ministry of health regional reference laboratory in jeddah, saudi arabia, where they were
subjected to real-time reverse-transcriptase–
polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) assays to
test for mers-cov.20 for all patients, the results
of rt-pcr tests were confirmed by measuring
cycle-threshold values for viral load.
identification of clusters, collection
of case data, and assessment of exposure

in response to an increase in the incidence of
pneumonia among patients undergoing hemodialysis, hospital a initiated active surveillance for
pneumonia on april 20, 2013, and conducted a
retrospective review of in-hospital deaths and
cases of pneumonia from march 1 through april
19. we also reviewed the medical charts of patients with confirmed mers-cov infection to
identify symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical course. the ministry of health interviewed

hospital outbreak of mers coronavirus

household contacts of patients with confirmed
mers-cov infection and followed them for 14
days after exposure.
we mapped confirmed and probable merscov cases in time and in space within health care
facilities. for each case, we identified potential
exposures, with the assumption that face-to-face
contact or time spent in the same area conferred
a greater risk than shared caregivers, which in
turn conferred a greater risk than shared equipment. no assumptions were made about incubation periods. three of the authors reviewed potential exposures independently; when more than
one potential exposure was possible, the most
likely source of exposure was identified by consensus among those authors and an additional
author. the corresponding author vouches for the
accuracy and completeness of the data.
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

full-genome sequences were obtained from specimens from four patients (patients i, j, k, and v)
(see table s1 in the supplementary appendix, available with the full text of this article at nejm.org).
amplicon products were sequenced with the use
of the illumina miseq sequencer and assembled
into full genomes by means of assembly with the
spades 2 genome assembler, version 2.4.0. assemblies were validated with the use of referencebased assembly (smalt, version 0.7.4). the open
reading frames of the novel genomes and a comparison of nucleotide changes relative to the
closest existing mers genome (england2_hpa)
were analyzed with the use of python scripts.
full-length genomes were combined with
five previously identified mers-cov genomes
(kc776174, jx869059, kc667074, emc/munich/
abudhabi/2013, and england2) and aligned with
the use of molecular evolution genetics analysis,
version 5 (mega5), software. a second alignment was created to include only coding regions
(orf1ab, s, orf3, orf4a, orf4b, orf5, e, m,
n). maximum-likelihood phylogenies were inferred with the use of phylogenetic estimation
using maximum likelihood (phyml), version 3.0,
software and bootstrapped 1000 times to assess
confidence. further time-resolved phylogenetic
trees were obtained from concatenated coding
alignment with the use of bayesian evolutionary
analysis by sampling trees (beast), version 1.7.5,
software. the likelihoods of runs under different
models were compared, and a maximum clade
n engl j med 369;5

credibility tree was used to summarize the most
likely model.
statistical analysis

we calculated empirical cumulative density functions of the incubation period and serial intervals
by computing the cumulative fraction of all observations that fell below each observed value in
the respective data sets. we estimated the incubation period by identifying the earliest and latest
time of possible exposure and the time of symptom onset for each case. treating these times as
interval-censored estimates of the incubation period for each person, we fit a log-normal distribution to these data using maximum-likelihood
techniques. we then examined the robustness of
our estimates with multiple definitions of onset
and with the exclusion of particular cases.
we estimated the serial interval by identifying the times of symptom onset in the patient
and in the person who transmitted the infection
(infected–infector pairs) and then fitting a lognormal distribution to these interval-censored
data.21 we estimated the medians and 5th and
95th percentiles of the incubation period and the
serial interval using the quantiles of the lognormal distribution fit to each data set (r statistical package, version 2.15.1, and coarsedatatools library).21

description of the outbreak

between april 1 and may 23, 2013, a total of 23
confirmed cases of human infection with merscov were identified in the eastern province of
saudi arabia (fig. s1 in the supplementary appendix). all confirmed cases and 11 probable cases
were part of a single outbreak involving four
health care facilities (fig. 1).

all confirmed and probable cases are shown, according to the location of the most probable transmission. one of the five family contacts (patient m) who is included as having been exposed in hospital a was also exposed through caring for the patient at home and
may have acquired the infection either in the hospital or in the community.

fever developed, and a throat-swab specimen was
obtained, which was negative for mers-cov.
when pneumonia developed in the patient, merscov was identified on repeat testing. no epidemiologic link between patients a and b could be
established.
patient c, who had been undergoing long-term
hemodialysis, was admitted to hospital a on
april 6 to the room adjacent to patient a. he was
still in that room on april 8, which was the day
on which fever developed in patient a. fever developed in patient c 3 days later. he underwent
dialysis in the hospital’s outpatient hemodialysis
unit twice after the onset of symptoms — on
april 11 and april 13.
hemodialysis unit

between april 14 and april 30, mers-cov infection was confirmed in nine additional patients,
who were undergoing hemodialysis in hospital a
(fig. s2 in the supplementary appendix). six of
these patients (patients d, e, f, g, h, and i) un410

with the times patient c was undergoing hemodialysis on either april 11 or april 13; three of
them underwent the procedure in beds adjacent

underwent hemodialysis at times that overlapped
with the times patient f was undergoing hemodialysis after the onset of his symptoms, and one
patient (patient l) underwent hemodialysis in a
bed adjacent to symptomatic patient e. eight additional probable cases occurred among patients
undergoing hemodialysis between april 15 and
april 30. there were no links between individual
dialysis nurses or machines and case patients.
among the nine patients undergoing hemodialysis at hospital a who had confirmed merscov infection, eight had an onset of disease
before or within 24 hours after infection-control
interventions were implemented on april 21.
these interventions included monitoring hand
hygiene, implementing droplet and contact precautions for febrile patients, testing patients with
fever for mers-cov, putting masks on all pa-

a total of 217 household contacts of patients interval

with confirmed cases were followed up, including 120 adults (median age, 26 years; range, 18 to

probable (fig. 2, and fig. s2 and table s1 in the
supplementary appendix).
illness with onset in other health care
facilities

patient q, who became infected with mers-cov
in the icu of hospital a, had been undergoing
long-term hemodialysis at an outpatient clinic in
hospital c and underwent hemodialysis in that
unit while he was symptomatic. mers-cov infection developed in two additional patients (patients t and w) at hospital c. patient t regularly
traveled from home to the dialysis unit with patient q. patient w underwent hemodialysis in the
same 13-bed room and during the same shift as
patient q.
eight patients (patients b, e, f, g, h, i, k,
and l) with confirmed mers-cov infection were
transferred to hospital d between april 18 and
april 27. mers-cov infection developed in two
patients (patients x and y) who were hospitalized
on the same ward as patient g and in a physician (patient v) who cared for patient k. overall,
two laboratory-confirmed cases occurred among
more than 200 health care worker contacts who
were followed after exposure.
demographic and clinical features

most of the case patients were men, and the median age was 56 years (table 1). the most common signs and symptoms were fever (in 87% of
the patients) and cough (in 87%), and 35% presented with vomiting or diarrhea. among patients in whom the illness progressed, the median time from the onset of symptoms to icu
admission was 5 days (range, 1 to 10), the median time to the need for mechanical ventilation
was 7 days (range, 3 to 11), and the median time
to death was 11 days (range, 5 to 27). three of
four patients (75%) whose cases were detected by
active surveillance during the outbreak, as compared with 3 of 19 (16%) whose cases were identified clinically, have recovered (p = 0.04).

one patient transmitted the infection to seven
persons, one patient transmitted the infection to
three persons, and four patients transmitted the
infection to two persons each. the incubation
period of confirmed cases was 5.2 days (95%
confidence interval [ci], 1.9 to 14.7) (fig. 3); distributions that were fit to our observed data indicated that 95% of infected patients would have
an onset of symptoms by day 12.4 (95% ci of
95th percentile, 7.3 to 17.5), whereas 5% would
have an onset of symptoms by day 2.2 (95% ci of
5th percentile, 1.2 to 3.1).
we estimated that the serial interval was 7.6
days (95% ci, 2.5 to 23.1) (fig. 3). the distributions that were fit to our observed data indicate
that the serial interval was less than 19.4 days in
95% of cases (95% ci of 95th percentile, 11.7 to
27.0) and less than 3.0 days in 5% of cases (95%

among the four mers-cov isolates, al-hasa_1_
2013 (genbank accession number, kf186567)
from patient v and al-hasa_4_2013 (kf186564)
from patient k have identical genomes, whereas
al-hasa_2_2013 (kf186566) from patient j and
al-hasa_3_2013 (kf186565) from patient i have
two or three nucleotide differences from al-hasa_
1_2013 (fig. 4a).
phylogenetic analysis of the four mers-cov
genomes showed that the viruses form a monophyletic clade with a bootstrap support of 100%
(fig. 4b). the most closely related sequence to
this clade is england2, with a genetic distance
of 0.0008 substitutions per site. the al-hasa
lineage has 15 defining mutations (4 nonsynonymous: a1643s and v2550i in orf1ab, q1208h
in s protein, and f58s in orf3).
we estimated that the date of the most recent
common ancestor of mers-cov was august 18,
2011 (95% highest posterior density [hpd, intervals for nucleotide sequences], november 1,
2009, to april 14, 2012). the date of the divergence of the al-hasa lineage was december 6,
2012 (95% hpd, july 18, 2012, to february 3,
2013), and the date of the most recent common
ancestor of the al-hasa lineage was april 2,

hospital outbreak of mers coronavirus

discussion
acute viral respiratory tract infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality and pose a risk
of outbreaks in health care settings.25-27 we describe a cluster of mers-cov infections and report health care–associated human-to-human
transmission of mers-cov. the 65% case fatality rate in this outbreak is of concern.
we and others have found that the severity of
illness associated with mers-cov infection
ranges from mild to fulminant.7,9-17 the clinical
syndrome is similar to sars, with an initial
phase of nonspecific fever and mild, nonproductive cough, which may last for several days before progressing to pneumonia.28 some patients
with mers-cov infection also had gastrointestinal symptoms, a finding similar to that with
sars.29 mers-cov is known to infect cell lines
of the intestinal tract,30 but it is not yet known
what proportion of ill patients shed virus in
their stool. in the majority of patients in this
cluster, fever was high and persistent, but the
pattern of pulmonary involvement on chest radiography was variable. it is noteworthy that the
survival rate was higher among patients whose
cases were identified by means of active surveillance during the outbreak than among those
whose cases were identified clinically. although
a possible explanation is that the patients whose
cases were identified by means of active surveillance were younger and healthier than the patients with primary cases, it is more likely that
enhanced surveillance was more effective at detecting less severe disease than was identification of clinical features.
our estimates of the distribution of the incubation period are similar to those for sars-cov
infection, which was estimated to have a median
incubation period of 4.0 days, with 5% of cases
developing within 1.8 days and 95% within 10.6
days.31 our estimates of the serial interval of
mers-cov infection are somewhat shorter than
those for sars-cov (median, 7.6 days vs. 8.4
days), perhaps because transmission of merscov infection appears to occur earlier in the
course of the illness.32 our small sample led to
wide confidence intervals; however, bootstrapped
sampling of our data showed the robustness of
our estimates with the inclusion and exclusion
of particular cases.
the rapid transmission and high attack rate
in the dialysis unit raises substantial concerns

figure 3. estimates of the incubation period and serial interval of mers-cov infection.
the empirical cumulative density function of the observed cases (the fraction of all observations that fell below each
observed value) (black lines) with respect to the incubation period (panel a) and serial interval (the time between
the onset of illness in a case patient and the onset of illness in a contact) (panel b) is shown, with a plot of the cumulative distribution of log-normal distributions fit to the data indicated by thick yellow and blue lines, respectively.
the 95% confidence intervals for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of these fitted distributions are indicated by the
yellow and blue horizontal lines. yellow and blue shading indicates cumulative distributions of log-normal distributions fit to bootstrapped samples of our observed data.

about the risk of health care–associated transmission of this virus. the apparent heterogeneity in transmission, with many infected patients
not transmitting disease at all and one patient
transmitting disease to seven others, is reminiscent of sars.33,34
epidemiologic and phylogenetic analyses support person-to-person transmission; however, it
is not possible to be certain about whether there
were single or multiple introductions from the
community. similarly, we are unable to determine whether person-to-person transmission
occurred through respiratory droplets or through
direct or indirect contact and whether the virus
was transmitted when the contact was more
than 1 m away from the case patient. because
some patients presented with gastrointestinal
symptoms, and transmission appeared to occur
between rooms on the ward, the current who
recommendations for surveillance and control
should be regarded as the minimum standards35;
hospitals should use contact and droplet precautions and should consider the follow-up of persons who were in the same ward as a patient
with mers-cov infection.
it is possible to explain all the episodes of
transmission in this outbreak by assuming that
patients were infectious only when they were
414

n engl j med 369;5

symptomatic; however, this does not rule out
transmission during the incubation phase or
during asymptomatic infection. because this
was a retrospective investigation, we may have
missed exposures that were not documented or
that were forgotten; we may also have misclassified community-acquired cases as health care–
associated cases. our choice of the most likely
exposure to link patients may have been incorrect. despite these limitations, multiple iterations
of transmission mapping resulted in maps with
similar overall results.
laboratory testing for mers-cov remains a
challenge. validated serologic assays are not yet
available, and this may have limited the identification of cases. in this cluster, results of throat
swabs were occasionally negative and repeat testing for mers-cov was required. it is not clear
whether sputum or nasopharyngeal samples
might be superior to throat samples or whether
virus is shed more abundantly later in the course
of the illness or in more severe illness, as it is in
sars.36 it seems prudent to conclude that one
cannot reliably rule out mers-cov disease on
the basis of a single negative test when a patient
presents with the appropriate clinical syndrome
and epidemiologic exposure. there is evidence
that repeat testing and tests on sputum or

figure 4. phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of all genes identified in four patients infected with mers-cov.
panel a shows single-nucleotide differences (vertical colored bars) between the england2 genome and the four al-hasa genomes as
well as the four additional full genomes available; gray indicates a gap in the query sequence, orange a change to a, crimson a change
to t, blue a change to g, and purple a change to c. the reference genomes we used were from a jordanian patient in april 2012 (genbank accession number, kc776174), emc/2012 from a saudi arabian patient in july 2012 (jx869059),19 england/qatar/2012 from a london qatari patient in september 2012 (kc667074),22 england2 from a patient who had traveled to pakistan and saudi arabia in february
2013,13 and the munich/abudhabi sequence from a patient from the united arab emirates in march 2013.23 panel b shows an unrooted
maximum-likelihood phylogeny inferred under a generalized-time-reversal (gtr)+gamma substitution model that compares the five
previously identified middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) genomes with the four al-hasa genomes. bootstrap values are shown
for the highly supported nodes. panel c shows a time-resolved maximum clade credibility tree for the five previously identified genomes and the four al-hasa mers coronavirus genomes. posterior probability values are shown for nodes with posterior support
greater than 0.5. findings are consistent with previously published estimates.24

bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid are of value in improving diagnostic accuracy.
the repeated introduction of the infection
into the community, the ongoing detection of
new illness, and the substantial impact of hospital transmission in this outbreak underscore the
importance of investigations into the community source of mers-cov. without the ability to
prevent community infection, prevention of health
care transmission will remain a challenge. outbreak-control measures included precautions for
n engl j med 369;5

patients until 24 hours after symptoms resolved.
to date, the ministry of health has found no
evidence of transmission from patients in whom
precautions have been discontinued. further investigations to identify the duration of viral
shedding as well as the complete spectrum of
disease are needed to refine public health recommendations.
