background: since the early 1980s, case fatality of patients with ards has decreased, and
explanations are unclear.
design and methods: using identical definitions of ards and organ failure, we analyzed
consecutive cohorts of patients meeting syndrome criteria at our institution in 1982 (n ⴝ 46),
1990 (n ⴝ 112), 1994 (n ⴝ 99), and 1998 (n ⴝ 205) to determine causes and timing of death.
results: overall case fatality has decreased from 68% in 1981–1982 to a low of 29% in 1996,
plateauing since the mid-1990s (p ⴝ 0.001 for trend). sepsis syndrome with multiple organ failure
remains the most common cause of death (30 to 50%), while respiratory failure causes a small
percentage (13 to 19%) of deaths. the distribution of causes of death has not changed over time.
there was no change in the timing of death during the study periods: 26 to 44% of deaths
occurred early (< 72 h after ards onset), and 56 to 74% occurred late (> 72 h after ards onset).
however, the increased survival over the past 2 decades is entirely accounted for by patients who
present with trauma and other risk factors for their ards, while survival for those patients whose
risk factor is sepsis has not changed. additionally, withdrawal of life support in these patients is
now occurring at our institution significantly more frequently than in the past, and median time
until death has decreased in patients who have support withdrawn.
conclusions: while these results do not explain the overall case fatality decline in ards, they do
indicate that sepsis syndrome remains the leading cause of death and suggest that future
therapies to improve survival be targeted at reducing the complications of sepsis.

when causes of death in ards patients were
analyzed by montgomery et al4 in 1982, sepsis
syndrome was the major cause of death, while only a
relatively small percentage (16%) of deaths were due
to insupportable respiratory failure. that study4 also
found that patients who died within the first 72 h
after ards onset usually died from the presenting
injury or illness that preceded ards onset. patients
whose deaths occurred ⬎ 72 h after ards onset
most often died from complications (ie, new organ
failures) that arose after ards began. prior studchest / 128 / 2 / august, 2005

ies7,8 have investigated whether a cause-specific decrease in death of ards patients accounts for the
overall case fatality decline, but at the present time it
remains unknown if cause of death in ards has
changed concurrently with case fatality. also unknown is whether a reduction in early or late deaths
explains the fall in case fatality, or if the reduced case
fatality has varied by ards risk factor. furthermore,
several studies9 –11 have reported that withdrawal of
life support in critically ill patients is occurring more
frequently now than in the past, but the timing of
withdrawal of life support in relation to the onset of
ards remains unclear. we hypothesized that the
reduction in ards case fatality over the past 2
decades was related to a change in the relative
frequency of sepsis syndrome and multiple organ
failure (mof) as the cause of death.
gaining insight into the reported decrease in
ards case fatality and into changes in ards
epidemiology is important to fully understand the
appropriate targets for new therapies. to investigate
causes and timing of death, we analyzed these factors
in ards patients in 1990, 1994, and 1998. using
identical definitions of ards and irreversible organ
dysfunction leading to death as those used by montgomery et al,4 we then compared these data with
those from that original study to identify trends over
nearly 2 decades at a single institution. while longitudinal mortality rates have been reported,12 to our
knowledge there has not been a study that has
longitudinally examined causes of death in ards
using prospectively identified patients and applying
consistent definitions of organ failure over time.

materials and methods
since 1983, all ards patients at harborview medical center
(a level i trauma center) have been identified via prospective
daily icu surveillance using the following definition: (1) pao2/
fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) ratio ⱕ 150, or ⱕ 200 while
receiving positive end-expiratory pressure ⱖ 5 cm h2o; (2)
opacities on chest radiography involving at least 50% of three or
four quadrants; (3) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ⱕ 18 mm
hg or no other clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension; and
(4) no other obvious explanation for these findings.5,13 these
patients are identified by a specific screening protocol that is
applied by research personnel such that physician diagnosis is not
relied on. at ards onset, recorded data include age, gender,
apache (acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation) ii
score,14 injury severity score (iss),15 date of ards onset, and
ards risk factor (sepsis syndrome, trauma, or other [pancreatitis, near drowning, inhalation injury, massive transfusion, aspiration, other]). specific criteria are used to identify risk factors.13
criteria for sepsis syndrome are shown in table 1. patients are
followed up until hospital discharge or death and are classified as
survived or deceased; thus, case fatality data are available for each
year since 1983.
data from three cohorts of deceased patients (1990, 1994,
1998) were abstracted by individual authors (k.p.s., b.m.w., and
526

r.d.s., respectively) and compared with the study by montgomery et al4 (performed during a 15-month period from 1981 to
1982, which we will call 1982) to identify trends in mortality. six
charts (⬎ 10%) from each of 1982, 1990, and 1994 were also
abstracted by r.d.s. to ensure accuracy. these cohorts were
chosen because of their relatively even temporal spacing and
because they preceded recent advances in ards management
strategies that improve survival and may have confounded our
results.16 had we chosen to examine more recent cohorts, we
would not have able to adequately adjust for tidal volume in
milliliters per kilogram of predicted body weight because height
and weight data are not available for earlier cohorts. charts for
deceased patients in each cohort were retrieved and reviewed.
for each patient, four features of the death were recorded: (1)
cause, (2) timing after ards onset, (3) occurrence of withdrawal
of life support, and (4) with or without ards. cause of death was
further categorized as attributable to the presenting injury/illness
or progression of ards risk factor present prior to onset,
insupportable respiratory failure, or complications that arose
after ards onset.
cause of death was defined as irreversible organ dysfunction
that either resulted directly in the patient’s death or in withdrawal of life support. identical criteria for grading organ dysfunction, originally established by montgomery et al,4 were used
in all four patient cohorts (table 1). rigorous inspection of
temporal relationships of laboratory data, hemodynamic and
respiratory parameters, and nursing and physician notes was used
to identify one of nine causes of death: sepsis with mof,
respiratory, cardiac, cns, hematologic, hemorrhage, hepatic, gi,
and renal.
like the study by montgomery et al,4 severe sepsis syndrome
did not require the presence of suspected or proven infection
(table 1). sepsis/mof was defined as sepsis syndrome in
combination with two other severe organ system dysfunctions.
for a patient to be classified as dying from sepsis without
withdrawal of life support occurring, the death must have
occurred directly from irreversible septic shock. withdrawal of
life support was defined as the removal of life-sustaining measures and was determined by locating evidence in the chart of a
clear intention to discontinue life support. the decision to
withdraw life support was made in several patients due to their
mof and grim prognosis. all of these patients had severe sepsis
syndrome, thereby meeting the definition of sepsis with mof.
therefore, patients who died directly from septic shock and those
who died after withdrawal of life support secondary to sepsis and
mof were combined into one sepsis/mof group.
similar to the study by montgomery et al,4 timing of death was
considered “early” if it occurred within 72 h after ards onset
and “late” if ⬎ 72 h after ards onset.4 patients were classified as
having died without ards only if they achieved unassisted
breathing, defined as one of the following criteria: (1) extubation
(excluding patients extubated as withdrawal of support); (2)
mechanical ventilation on pressure-support mode of ⱕ 5 cm h2o
and fio2 of ⱕ 0.4; or (3) continuation of intubation on a t-piece
for airway protection purposes.
a death was categorized as due to the presenting injury/illness
or progression of the ards risk factor if it was associated with
conditions that preceded ards onset. for example, if ards
developed in a trauma patient presenting with severe head injury
but eventually had life support withdrawn secondary to neurologic devastation, the death was classified as due to the presenting
injury/illness. similarly, if ards developed secondary to sepsis
syndrome caused by bowel perforation that was operatively
repaired and death subsequently occurred due to progressive
sepsis/mof, the death was also classified as secondary to the
presenting illness/injury or progression of the ards risk factor.

the cause of death were classified as dying secondary to insupportable respiratory failure. finally, deaths were coded as due to
complications after ards onset if the cause was related to a
condition or new organ failure that was not present prior to
ards onset. for example, if ards developed in a burn patient
with inhalation injury but 3 weeks later sepsis developed and the
patient died, this death would be classified as secondary to
complications after ards onset. patients transferred to other
acute care facilities receiving mechanical ventilation were identified, and information was obtained regarding their outcome.

were 112, 99, and 205 patients, respectively, who
met our ards criteria. there were no significant
differences in gender, ards risk factor, or iss
between the four cohorts of patients. however, age
and apache ii score have changed significantly
over time, such that ards patients now are slightly
older and have a slightly greater apache ii score
(table 2). in 1998, there were 13 patients who were
still receiving mechanical ventilation when they left
our institution and were transferred to another hospital or long-term ventilatory facility. five of these
patients survived and were weaned from the ventilator, seven of them died while still ventilator dependent, and one had an unknown outcome and was
considered to be alive. we do not have data on the
seven deceased patients to determine their causes of
death.

1990s (p ⫽ 0.001 for trend; fig 1). the distribution
of specific causes of death, however, has not significantly changed over time in our cohorts, as shown in
table 3 with cause-specific deaths expressed as a
percentage of total deaths. sepsis syndrome/mof
has remained the leading cause of death in all four
cohorts of patients (30 to 50%), with cns as the
second most common cause (19 to 29%). insupportable respiratory failure was responsible for a relatively small and similar percentage of deaths in each
cohort (16%, 14%, 19%, and 13%, respectively).
even though ards was the direct cause of death in
only a few patients, it was present in the majority of
patients at the time of death (88%, 86%, 88%, and
96% in 1981–1982, 1990, 1994, and 1998, respectively).
timing of death in ards, divided into early and
late deaths and then further categorized as due to
presenting injury/illness, respiratory failure, or a
complication occurring after ards onset, has also

not changed significantly over the past 2 decades
(fig 2). twenty-nine percent of deaths occurred
early (⬍ 72 h after ards onset) in 1981–1982, 30%
in 1990, 44% in 1994, and 26% in 1998 (p ⫽ 0.29 for
trend). the majority of early deaths in all four
cohorts of patients were due to the primary injury or
illness. montgomery et al4 found in 1982 that the
majority of patients dying late died from a complication that arose after ards onset.4 this was not the
case in 1990, 1994, and 1998, when late deaths most
commonly occurred secondary to the presenting
injury or illness.
there has, however, been a significant change in
the case fatality of ards patients when stratified by
risk factor (fig 3), such that the case fatality
of ards patients who present with trauma

(p ⫽ 0.043 for trend) has decreased, but the case

the percentage of deaths in ards patients occurring
in the setting of withdrawal of life support has
significantly increased over time (40%, 56%, 63%,
and 67% of deaths in 1981–1982, 1990, 1994, and
1998, respectively) [p ⫽ 0.03 for trend; fig 4]. despite the increasing occurrence of withdrawal of life
support, the median time of death in all ards
patients has not changed significantly, as shown in
table 4 (10.0 days after ards onset in 1981–1982,
10.4 days in 1990, 3.5 days in 1994, and 7.1 days in
1998; p ⫽ 0.38). however, the median time of death
in patients who died after support withdrawal has
significantly decreased (15.5 days in 1981–1982, 10.5
days in 1990, 3.3 days in 1994, and 7.0 days in 1998;
p ⫽ 0.04).

this study found that the significant decline in
ards case fatality since the 1980s is associated with
neither a change in the distribution of causes of
death nor a selective decrease in early or late deaths.
despite increasing age and severity of illness, fewer
patients are dying, and the improvement is seen
across all causes of death. sepsis syndrome with
mof remains the leading cause of death, and
insupportable respiratory failure is an uncommon
cause. the majority of improvement in case fatality
can be accounted for by patients with trauma and
“other” risk factors for ards, while the case fatality
of patients whose risk is sepsis has not changed.
additionally, withdrawal of life support is occurring
more frequently in ards patients at our institution
now than in the past, and the median time from
ards onset to death in patients who have support
withdrawn has decreased.
the main strength of this study is that, to our
knowledge, it is the only investigation that has examined causes and timing of death in ards patients
longitudinally, using prospectively identified patients
and applying identical definitions. this uniformity in
definitions permits direct comparison of patients over
time to investigate changes in ards epidemiology.
additionally, with 462 patients, this study is larger than
most series examining mortality in ards. another
strength is that while overall case fatality has declined,
ards patients at our institution seem to be more ill
now than in the past, with increased age and apache

ii score on the day of ards onset, both factors that are
associated with increased mortality.13,17,18
this study reconfirms an important result of the
study by montgomery et al,4 that insupportable respiratory failure is a relatively uncommon cause of death
in ards patients.4 death from respiratory failure
occurs in only 13% of all ards deaths and 5% of all
ards cases at our institution. at the same time, ards
is present in nearly all patients who die.
most improvement in survival observed over the past
20 years is explained by reduced case fatality in patients
with a risk factor other than sepsis. our trauma patients
are younger than those in the other two risk factor
groups (median ages, 39.8 years for trauma, 49.0 years
for sepsis, and 43.0 years for other). however, the age
of trauma and sepsis patients has not changed over
time, and apache ii scores for patients in all three
risk factor groups have significantly increased over time

(data not shown). therefore, changes in age or severity
of illness between the three risk factor groups do not
explain the survival improvement limited to the trauma
and “other” patients.
withdrawal of life support in ards has increased
over time. in 1998 at our institution, 67% of all ards
deaths occurred after support withdrawal. this value is
similar to the 90% reported by prendergast and luce.9
furthermore, time from ards onset to death in those
patients who have support withdrawn is decreasing.
the withdrawal of support definition was applied identically in all four cohorts, thus ruling out the possibility
that this trend is due to differences in data collection.
we also doubt this trend can be explained by an
increased prevalence of advanced directives among our
patients, since several studies19 –21 have concluded that
advanced directives do not affect aggressiveness of
care, initiation of do-not-resuscitate orders, or attempts

at resuscitation. a more probable explanation is that
physicians may be initiating end-of-life discussions earlier and more frequently with families of patients who
will likely die.
there are some important limitations to this study.
first, identification of cause of death is partially subjective, and interobserver variability could have contributed to variations in assignment. in addition to using
consistent definitions, six charts (⬎ 10%) from deceased patients in the earliest three cohorts were
reviewed by the author who abstracted the 1998 charts,
and the assignment of causes was identical. thus, we
believe that the definitions have been reliably assigned
over time. second, the increase in withdrawal of life
support makes identification of true cause of death
difficult. in all four cohorts, cause of death after
support withdrawal was defined as the irreversible
organ dysfunction that directly led to the withdrawal of
support. it is possible that these patients might have
died from another cause had withdrawal of support not
occurred.
our definitions of ards and sepsis may affect the
generalizability of these results. the ards definition
used in this study was established at our institution
prior to the american-european consensus conference on ards.22 our definition describes a more
severe subset of ards patients. since 1994, we have
utilized both definitions for research, but we believed it
necessary to use identical definitions over time in this
study to longitudinally compare ards case fatality.
additionally, our definition of sepsis syndrome predates
the american college of chest physicians/society of
critical care medicine consensus conference on defining sepsis.23 in this study, sepsis syndrome can be
present without any direct evidence of infection, and
therefore may be reflective of a systemic inflammatory
state from any cause. again, we believed it appropriate
to use the definition of montgomery et al4 in all four
cohorts of patients for consistency.
generalizability of this study may also be limited by
our patient population. the annual number of ards
patients at our institution has greatly increased over
time, from 46 patients in 1982 to ⬎ 200 patients in
1998. we believe this is simply a result of increased
icu bed capacity (increased from 36 to 65 icu beds
during the course of the study), leading to changes in
www.chestjournal.org

regional referral patterns rather than any change in
screening techniques or other selection biases. however, we cannot absolutely exclude the possibility of
changes in physician awareness or screening, such that
more ards patients are being identified.
additionally, a high percentage of trauma-related
ards cases are seen at our institution. our results are
different than those reported by suchyta et al7 in 1992,
who applied definitions of organ dysfunction of montgomery et al4 to identify cause of death. in that study,
respiratory failure accounted for 40% of deaths and
sepsis accounted for 32%. this difference may be
explained by the marked dissimilarity in patient populations between the two institutions. trauma was the
risk factor in 20 to 41% of our ards patients compared with 13% of their patients. on the contrary, our
results are very similar to those reported by ferring and
vincent8 in 1997, who found an overall ards case
fatality of 52% and concluded that sepsis syndrome/
mof was still the leading cause of ards deaths at
49% while respiratory failure caused 16% of deaths,
despite their population being more akin to that of
suchyta et al.7
although not confirmed by this study, several reasons for the overall improved survival of ards patients
have been hypothesized, including early and aggressive
antibiotic use, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and improved
nutritional and fluid support.24 –27 the national institutes of health ards network trial16 in 2000 found
that low tidal volume ventilation significantly improved
survival. additionally, a more recent study28 reported
fewer organ failures in a 1994-to-1999 cohort of ards
patients when compared to a 1987-to-1990 cohort at a
single institution, suggesting that perhaps this has contributed to the decrease in ards case fatality. however, that investigation did not examine cause or timing
of death specifically.28
while we were unable to explain the overall decline
in ards case fatalities, the finding remains that survival has improved among patients with a variety of
organ dysfunctions and has not changed among patients whose ards risk factor is sepsis. with sepsis
syndrome being both a risk factor for ards and the
most common cause of death among ards patients, it
is paramount to examine the interactions between lung
injury, systemic inflammation, and development of

mof. the fact that only a small percentage of ards
patients die from insupportable respiratory failure
likely explains why approaches to improve oxygenation
in ards, such as nitric oxide and partial liquid ventilation, have not improved survival.29 –31 furthermore,
in the national institutes of health ards network
trial,16 low tidal volume ventilation significantly improved survival despite an early adverse effect on
oxygenation.16 this finding, along with our results,
supports the hypothesis that systemic inflammation
induced by lung injury, either ventilator-induced lung
injury or ards itself, may lead to the development of
mof and death. therapies designed to only improve
gas exchange without reducing organ injury are unlikely
to change survival in unselected ards patients since
few patients die from hypoxemia. continued improvement in supportive care and in novel approaches to
reduce systemic inflammation may be important in
further decreasing case fatality in ards.
