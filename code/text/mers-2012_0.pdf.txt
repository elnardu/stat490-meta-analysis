coronaviruses have the potential to cause severe
transmissible human disease, as demonstrated by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak of
2003. we describe here the clinical and virological features of a novel coronavirus infection causing severe
respiratory illness in a patient transferred to london,
united kingdom, from the gulf region of the middle
east.

introduction

coronaviruses are recognised causes of mild respiratory tract infections in humans, first identified in the
1960s [1]. these large rna viruses affect a wide range
of animals including domestic and companion animals
and bats [2]. limited surveillance data show that bats
host the greatest diversity of coronaviruses, varying by
region and species [3], suggesting that they may be the
natural reservoir.
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak of 2003 – affecting over 8,000 people across
three continents with a case fatality ratio of about 10%
[4] – indicates the potential of an animal coronavirus to
jump species and transmit from person to person causing severe illness. this experience has raised awareness of the potential threat from zoonotic coronaviral
infections and the need to adopt strict infection control measures when such cases are found, especially in
healthcare settings. we describe here the clinical features and diagnostic detection of a novel coronavirus
infection in a severely ill adult transferred to london,
united kingdom, from the gulf region of the middle
east for medical care.

case history

on 14 september 2012, the united kingdom health
protection agency (hpa) imported fever service was
notified of a case of unexplained severe respiratory

illness in a london intensive care unit. the patient had
recently transferred from qatar and had a history of
travel to saudi arabia.
he was a previously well 49 year-old man who developed a mild undiagnosed respiratory illness while
visiting saudi arabia during august 2012, which fully
resolved. he subsequently presented to a physician
in qatar on 3 september, with cough, myalgia and
arthralgia, and was prescribed oral antibiotics. five
days later, he was admitted to a qatari hospital with
fever (38.4 °c) and hypoxia, with oxygen saturation
of 91% on room air. a chest x-ray showed bilateral
lower zone consolidation. he was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin and oseltamivir. after 48 hours,
he required intubation and ventilation and was transferred by air ambulance to london. during transfer, he
was clinically unstable, requiring manual ventilation.
on admission to intensive care in london, he remained
severely hypoxic, achieving an arterial pao2 of 6.5 kpa
(normal range: 11–13 kpa) on 100% oxygen with optimised pressure ventilation, and required low-dose
norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. his white
blood cell count was 9.1 x 109/l (normal range: 4–11 x
109/l), c-reactive protein 350 mg/l (normal range: 0–10
mg/l) and creatinine 353 μmol/l (normal range: 53–97
μmol/l), with normal liver function and coagulation.
he was treated with corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, initially meropenem, clarithromycin
and teicoplanin. colistin and liposomal amphotericin b
were subsequently added.
his condition deteriorated between 11 and 20
september, with progressive hypoxia. his c-reactive
protein level peaked at 440 mg/l and procalcitonin at
68 ng/ml (normal level: <0.5 ng/ml). his renal function worsened and haemofiltration was initiated on 14

care unit and on 20 september (day 17 of illness), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) was started.
as of 2 october, he remains stable but fully dependent
on ecmo after 13 days (day 30 of illness).

diagnostic approach

microbiological diagnostics in qatar and london were
used to look initially for common viral and bacterial
causes of severe respiratory illness and subsequently
for pathogens endemic in the middle east (table 1). by
mid-september, the syndrome was considered most
compatible with viral pneumonia. upper and lower respiratory tract samples were sent to the hpa respiratory
virus unit for extended influenza testing; all were negative. on 20 september, a promed report described

a novel human coronavirus recovered from an adult
male saudi arabian who died in june 2012 following
acute respiratory illness, pneumonia and renal failure
[5]. the erasmus medical center (the netherlands) had
sequenced the virus and identified it as a previously
undescribed coronavirus, related to known bat coronaviruses. given that the patient described in our report
had travelled to saudi arabia, hpa, in consultation with
local clinicians, decided to investigate samples from
the patient for the presence of the novel coronavirus.

detection of a novel coronavirus

we used real-time pcr on upper (nose and throat
swabs) and lower respiratory tract samples (sputum
and tracheal aspirates) to test for a range of coronaviruses: oc43, 229e, nl63 and sars-cov. we also used

results of specific real-time pcr assays [10] directed towards the upstream e gene (upe) and the orf 1b region of the new coronavirus tested
against cultured virus from the patient who died in saudi arabia, and clinical material from the confirmed case of novel coronavirus in
london.

a block-based pan-coronavirus pcr with degenerate
primers targeted to the conserved rna-dependent rna
polymerase (rdrp pol) gene that detects all coronaviruses known to infect humans and a range of animal
coronaviruses [6]. the pan-coronavirus assay yielded a
band of the correct size in lower respiratory tract samples, but the assays for oc43, 229e, nl63 and sarscoronaviruses were negative. sanger sequencing of
the pan-coronavirus pcr product (a 251 base pair fragment encompassing nucleotides 104–354 of the nsp12
gene) yielded a sequence that on blast analysis gave
genetic identity of 81% to bat coronavirus/133/2005
(genbank accession number dq648794.1) and 75%
identity to porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus strain vw572 (genbank accession number
dq011855.1) the sequence identified is available on
the hpa website [7]. in response to this identification,
a new set of real-time rt pcr assays were developed
[8]. the results of these assays tested on novel coronavirus tissue culture material and clinical samples from
this confirmed case are shown in table 2.
on the basis of the sequence obtained, a maximum
likelihood tree (figure) showed that the virus belongs
to the genus betacoronavirus, with closest relationships to bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5. viruses
that share more than 90% sequence identity in the
conserved replicase domain are considered to belong
to the same species by the international committee on
taxonomy of viruses (ictv). our sequence comparisons suggested that the virus nucleic acid fragment
identified is derived from a novel coronavirus that is
distinct from all coronaviruses described to date.

www.eurosurveillance.org

a total of 13 close contacts of the index case were identified who had developed mild self-limiting respiratory illnesses since exposure to the case [8]. ten of
these have had nose and throat swabs tested by pancoronavirus assay and the novel coronavirus was not
detected.

discussion

ascribing viral taxonomy on the basis of a small segment of sequence representing less than 1% of a viral
genome is highly presumptive. however, the replicase
genes are extremely conserved within coronaviruses,
and the gene targeted by the pan-coronavirus assay is
highly correlated with taxonomic classification based
on the whole genome [9], confirming the choice of
assay and the validity of the phylogeny (figure). final
allocation of taxonomy and nearest neighbour relatedness will require more extensive sequence obtained
either through genomic analysis of virus isolates cultured from the available clinical material, or more
extensive partial genome sequence derived directly
from clinical material if virus isolation is not possible.
while most coronaviral infections of humans cause mild
illness, zoonotic transmission of animal coronaviruses
such as sars-cov can cause severe illness and death.
preliminary data sharing (ron fouchier, personal communication, 23 september 2012) indicates 99.5% identity over the region of the replicase compared with the
virus isolated from the patient in saudi arabia and
described in promed. this is confirmed by the publication of the whole genome sequence (genbank accession number jx869059.1). on the basis of the clinical
and virological features, we believe that the fragment

the sequence obtained at the health protection agency has been tentatively named as london1_novel cov 2012. the phylogenetic tree was
constructed with fasttree software, using the maximum-likelihood method with general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution.
bootstrap values were obtained with 1,000 replicates. coronavirus groups are shown on the right hand side of the tree, with 1, 2 and 3

of coronaviral sequence we have recovered represents
a novel human coronavirus causing a severe respiratory illness.
the rapid development of sensitive and specific
molecular diagnostics for new organisms is facilitated
by sharing information and data between laboratories with different capabilities or reagents. the initial
molecular approaches used in this case were part of a
broad screening approach based on experience gained
during the response to sars. the development of specific diagnostics for the novel coronavirus will improve
sensitivity and enable rapid exclusion or identification
of potential clinical cases.

the origin for this novel virus is unknown.
epidemiological human and animal investigations in
the region of origin are required to distinguish between
an animal reservoir that either directly or indirectly
transmits the virus occasionally to humans, and a previously unrecognised endemic infection of humans that
causes severe outcomes in a few of those infected.
distinguishing between these possibilities will require
wider application of more specific and sensitive molecular assays for coronaviruses, and greater awareness
of the possible presence of coronaviruses in human
acute severe respiratory illness. extensive serological
testing of potentially exposed human populations and
contacts will be a key indicator of the extent of disease
due to novel coronaviruses.
