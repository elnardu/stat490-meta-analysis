sum m a r y
a human coronavirus, called the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(mers-cov), was first identified in september 2012 in samples obtained from a
saudi arabian businessman who died from acute respiratory failure. since then,
49 cases of infections caused by mers-cov (previously called a novel coronavirus)
with 26 deaths have been reported to date. in this report, we describe a family case
cluster of mers-cov infection, including the clinical presentation, treatment outcomes, and household relationships of three young men who became ill with
mers-cov infection after the hospitalization of an elderly male relative, who died
of the disease. twenty-four other family members living in the same household and
124 attending staff members at the hospitals did not become ill. mers-cov infection may cause a spectrum of clinical illness. although an animal reservoir is suspected, none has been discovered. meanwhile, global concern rests on the ability of
mers-cov to cause major illness in close contacts of patients.

m

ers-cov was first reported in september 2012 in samples obtained from a saudi arabian businessman who died from acute respiratory and renal failure.1 as of may 28, 2013, a total of 49 cases of human
mers-cov infection with 26 deaths have been reported to the world health organization (who). mers-cov is the first betacoronavirus belonging to lineage c that
is known to infect humans.2 it belongs to the coronaviridae family, a group of
large, enveloped single-stranded rna viruses that are known for their genomic
plasticity and their ability to cause a range of infections in mammalian and avian
hosts. mers-cov is considered distinct3 from the coronavirus responsible for the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov), which is a virulent, transmissible
human pathogen that first emerged in southern china in the fall of 2002.4 by february 2003, it had spread from guangdong province to nearby hong kong and
vietnam and then on to more than 30 countries. before sars-cov disappeared in
the summer of 2003, the who documented 8000 infections and 774 deaths, involving many health care workers and family members of patients.4 mers-cov appears
to be as virulent as sars-cov but is distinguished by the relative absence of severe
disease among the close contacts of patients, except among those with immunosuppression.
we report a family cluster of mers-cov infections that occurred in november
2012: three confirmed cases and one probable case in an extended family living
in urban riyadh. included are data on the clinical presentation, treatment outcomes, and household relationships of three young men who became ill with
mers-cov infection after the hospitalization of an elderly male relative.

figure 1 illustrates the case progressions for the
four patients with either confirmed or probable
mers-cov infection. patient 1, a 70-year-old retired soldier with type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart
disease, and hypertension, had been unwell
since october 5, 2012, with fever, urinary retention, flank pain, diarrhea, renal colic, and urinary tract infection. on october 13, he was admitted to the hospital with cardiac failure. six
months before admission, he had traveled briefly to bahrain with two of his sons (patients 2
and 4) seeking treatment for chronic knee pain.
during the hospitalization for the febrile illness,
therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) was started, and hydrocortisone
was added to a regimen of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin–tazobactam, azithromycin,
and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole). chest radiography showed bilateral hilar interstitial infiltrates. with worsening cardiac and renal function, he was transferred to the cardiac critical
care unit, where he was intubated for mechanical ventilation and underwent hemodialysis.
microbiologic testing of sputum, endotracheal
aspirates, and bronchial-lavage fluids did not
identify an infectious cause. on hospital day 9,
cardiogenic and septic shock developed, and he
died on october 23, 2012.
patient 2, a 39-year-old saudi factory worker
and the eldest son of patient 1, presented on
october 28, 2012, to the hospital emergency
department with a 4-day history of fever, rigors,
anorexia, and a cough productive of purulent
blood-streaked sputum. he had been started on
therapy with oseltamivir 2 days earlier. he was a
long-term smoker, with a history of reactive airway disease but no previous hospitalizations. on
examination, he was febrile (temperature, 38.9°c),
with rales throughout right mid- to lower-lung
fields. chest radiography showed coalescing
patchy densities at the base of the right lung (fig.
2a). oral azithromycin and parenteral ceftriaxone
were added to oseltamivir. the patient’s oxygenation improved with cpap therapy, and he was
discharged the following morning. hours later,
he returned to the hospital with acute hypoxemia.
chest radiography showed worsening opacities,
and he was admitted directly to the intensive
care unit, where he was intubated and treated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics and hydrocortisone (fig. 2b). his condition continued to dete2488

riorate over the next 2 days, and he died on
november 2, 2012.
on november 3, 2012, patient 3, the previously healthy 16-year-old eldest son of patient 2
and grandson of patient 1, reported having fever,
malaise, sore throat, cough, and wheezing. over
the next 4 days, his symptoms worsened and he
became intolerant of food. on november 7, he
was admitted to the hospital with a temperature
of 38.8°c, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, myalgia, worsening cough, and headache. chest
radiography showed bilateral hilar infiltrates.
results on testing of routine blood counts, serum
electrolytes, and renal and liver function were
normal and remained unchanged during his hospitalization. he was treated with oseltamivir,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. by november 11,
the infiltrates had resolved; he was then switched
to oral antibiotics and discharged from the hospital.
on november 4, 2012, patient 4, the 31-yearold younger brother of patient 2 and son of patient 1, reported an acute onset of fever, rigors,
and night sweats, which were followed by cough
productive of blood-streaked sputum. he was a
smoker with no other coexisting illnesses and
no previous hospital admissions. although in no
acute distress, he was admitted to the hospital
on november 6 after chest radiography showed
coalescing airspace densities and was treated empirically with oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and glucocorticoids. leukopenia was
treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (g-csf). the vital signs remained stable;
blood-gas evaluations showed satisfactory oxygen levels while the patient was breathing ambient air. results on testing of serum electrolytes
and renal and liver function and coagulation profiles remained normal. on november 13, all antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and patient 4
was discharged home on november 14.

the four patients were members of a saudi extended family. patient 1 and his 2 sons (patients 2
and 4) were married and lived in separate apartments within one large house located in the southern area of riyadh. a total of 28 persons lived in
this extended household, including 9 children
under the age of 14 years. aside from the 4 patients included in this report, no other family
members had major respiratory symptoms or illness from september 2012 through april 2013.
this home is flanked by similar buildings on either side and is remote from any rural enterprises. there were no domestic animals in the immediate vicinity of the home, and the family did
not keep pets. the only animal exposure occurred with patient 4, who attended the slaughtering of a camel on october 24. no one had
traveled out of riyadh in the previous 3 months.
contact among family members was frequent but
occurred most often between husbands and wives
and their children (table 1).
all adult and adolescent male family members shared meals together and ate separately
from female relations and their young children.
the men also socialized and visited the local
mosque together. twelve family members of patient 1 occupied a large upstairs apartment; older
sons also shared space downstairs. patient 3
lived with his parents in an upstairs apartment
shared with seven siblings between the ages of
2 and 18 years. patient 4, his wife, and two children lived in a downstairs apartment. another
newly married brother occupied a separate downstairs unit. married daughters and their young
children were frequent visitors to the home, as
were cousins who lived in the immediate neighborhood.
after the onset of illness and before hospital
admissions, each patient was cared for at home
by family members; wives were the primary caregivers for the married men, and 16-year-old patient 3 was cared for by his mother and sisters.
the duration of the prehospital illness varied
for each patient: 10 days for patient 1, 4 days for
patient 2, 5 days for patient 3, and 3 days for
patient 4. as head of the family, patient 1 also
had frequent contact with his two older sons,
patients 2 and 4, during the onset of the illness.

discussion
here we describe a family cluster of three confirmed cases and one probable case of merscov infection, using the case definition5 as reported to the who in november 2012. all four
male patients ranged in age from 16 to 70 years.
the male preponderance of the viral illness in
this family cluster remains to be explained. the
case progressions shown in figure 1 suggest that
two of the three confirmed infections (in patients 2 and 4) were probably secondary cases.
the third probable case (in patient 3) may have
been either a secondary or a tertiary infection.
there were two deaths: the index patient, an elderly man who had a number of coexisting illnesses, and a previously healthy young man.
both had severe pneumonia; the index patient
also had renal failure. of the two survivors, one
had lobar pneumonia that did not progress,
along with lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, both of which resolved. one probable case
(in patient 3), a previously healthy adolescent,
had a typical flu-like presentation plus radiologic
evidence of a lung infection, which did not progress to severe pneumonia.
viral loads in patients with sars-cov infection
were reported to be highest in the respiratory tract
10 days after the onset of symptoms, and shedding of virus in stool peaked on day 13.6 this
may explain the success of classic infectionn engl j med 368;26

control interventions in averting hospital outbreaks of sars-cov infection. in addition, elder­
ly patients with sars who had coexisting
illnesses, a long duration of illness, and an
atypical presentation transmitted infection more
often than did younger patients or those with
acute pneumonia. in the family case cluster in
our study, there was a similar pattern of illness
associated with mers-cov. although it is not
possible to exclude a single common source of
infection, patient 2 appears to have acquired the
infection from his father, perhaps after the father was hospitalized. the source of infection
for patients 3 and 4 is less obvious; they may
have had either secondary infection contracted
from patient 1 or tertiary infection contracted
from patient 2. patient 3 shared his father’s
apartment and was less exposed to his ill grandfather than he was to his father, patient 2.
none of the family’s female caregivers reported having a major respiratory illness from september 2012 through january 2013, though each
had repeated close contact with ill family members before their hospitalizations. this finding
may suggest that there is a reduced risk of disease transmission during the early stages of infection with mers-cov. female family members
did not visit their male relatives with any frequency once they were hospitalized. nine children under the age of 14 years shared the house,
and none became ill. again, their exposures came
before the hospitalizations of their relatives.
it is unclear when or how the presumed index
case, patient 1, might have become infected. the
source of mers-cov is being investigated in
animal reservoirs, but none has been found to
date. patient 1’s outpatient course was atypical
and protracted, as compared with secondary illnejm.org

ness in his sons and grandson. the disease onset and presentation may have been confounded
by preexisting heart failure and pulmonary edema. after he was admitted to the hospital, progressive severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure rapidly developed.
all four patients had similar symptoms at the
onset of infection, plus early evidence of an
evolving respiratory focus. symptoms at onset
included a temperature of more than 38°c, rigors, and malaise, followed by cough, myalgia,
and headache. productive cough with purulent,
blood-streaked sputum and exertional dyspnea
appeared early in the course of illness for patients 2 and 4, whereas it developed later in patient 1, and recognition was confounded by
preexisting pulmonary edema. patient 2 progressed rapidly to severe pneumonia and hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation.
neither patient who underwent mechanical ventilation survived. patient 3 had radiographic evidence of lung involvement, but his symptoms
remained mild throughout the hospital course.
despite having lobar pneumonia, patient 4 did
not have hypoxia.
acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis
was identified in two earlier saudi patients with
confirmed mers-cov infection.1,7 however, in
the family cluster reported here, only patient 1,
whose illness was prolonged and lung disease
severe, had renal failure, with renal function
that was compromised on admission. after subsequent progression to renal failure, he was
treated with regular hemodialysis. patient 2 may
have had similarly impaired renal function, but
he died of fulminant pneumonia.
three of the four patients had gastrointestinal symptoms: anorexia, abdominal pain, and
diarrhea. this complex of symptoms was also
shared by patients with sars, albeit by a minority. viral shedding in feces was ultimately important in understanding the epidemiologic features of sars cov infection in hong kong.8
hematologic abnormalities, in particular lymphocytopenia, had been identified as a clinical
feature in patients with sars.9 all four patients
in this cluster were similarly affected: patients 2,
3, and 4 had lymphocytopenia before hospital
admission, and patient 4 had progression to
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which was
treated with g-csf. patient 1 had unexplained
anemia requiring multiple transfusions during

m e dic i n e

the late course of his illness. of interest, patient 3
had transient but moderately severe pain in both
knees and lower back, which resolved as fever
and respiratory symptoms abated, suggesting a
possible immune-complex-mediated process.
an atypical presentation and prolonged outpatient course for the index case meant that all
27 members of this large family were exposed.
although 3 other family members became ill, 24
did not. three women in the family had repeated
face-to-face contact with the patients before hospitalization; all the women remained well, whereas 2 male family members who attended the
index patient before and during hospitalization
acquired the infection. although this suggests that
mers-cov, like sars-cov, is not readily transmitted early in the illness, other coronaviruses
(e.g., hcov-229e, hcov-nl63, and hcov-oc43)
appear to be transmitted earlier in the course of
disease. another explanation is that the index patient acquired the infection during hospitalization.
the family cluster cases describe a disease spectrum that includes an atypical presentation by the
index patient, severe disease and death in one previously healthy young contact, and milder illness in
two other young family members who were close
contacts. relatives and health staff contacts have
remained healthy for the past 6 months. table 2
shows some clinical features of mers-cov infection as compared with features of sars-cov infection: abrupt onset of high fever, rigors, and malaise, which progress to a productive cough and
pneumonia. three of the four patients in this cluster had gastrointestinal symptoms, and two had
diarrhea. hemodialysis was required only for the
index patient, who had preexisting chronic illness;
one other patient had an elevated creatinine level
on admission. lymphocytopenia, another prominent feature of sars-cov infection, was found in
all four patients and in the two patients whose
cases have been published previously. chest radiography of all patients showed lung infiltrates
soon after symptom onset; three of the four patients with progression to pneumonia had airspace
disease, in contrast with patients with sars-cov
pulmonary infection, who more often had atypical
pneumonias that were characterized by interstitial
infiltrates.
this report suggests that transmission of
mers-cov occurred among family members but
indicates that the risk of mers-cov infection
among close contacts of patients is low, although

infection risk is increased in patients with immunosuppression or coexisting illnesses. as of
may 28, 2013, a total of 49 confirmed cases of
mers-cov infection with 26 deaths (53% case
fatality rate) have been reported to the who2:
37 in saudi arabia (with 21 deaths), 2 in jordan
(with 2 deaths), 4 in the united kingdom (with
2 deaths), 2 in germany (with 1 death), 2 in
france (with no deaths), and 2 in tunisia (with
no deaths). current global concern rests on the
ability of mers-cov to cause major illness among

n engl j med 368;26

the close contacts of patients, particularly in family members, work colleagues, and health care
workers. serologic studies are required to further define the epidemiologic features, infectivity among asymptomatic contacts, and prevalence
in the community of mers-cov. the finding of
gastrointestinal symptoms in three of the four
patients in this study may be an important finding for mers-cov epidemiology, hospital infection-control measures, and contact isolation. further studies on shedding of mers-cov in stool

arabia. serologic testing of close contacts of patients with this disease will help to define local
transmission rates and risk factors. until now,
data on mers-cov cases were not sought outside the arabian peninsula because of restrictions in the initial who case definition for
screening for the presence of mers-cov. the
latest who interim surveillance guidelines (revised on march 18, 2013) have removed this
geographic restriction10 and will enable screening over a wider geographic area, which will
allow for a more accurate definition of the epidemiologic features of mers-cov infection. several major research challenges remain: rapid
detection and prevention of new cases through

the development and use of rapid, point-of-care
diagnostics,11 the performance of viral sequencing and genomic studies, and the identification
of the source of mers-cov. to achieve these
goals, more coordinated international collaboration and sharing of clinical and research data
and other information are urgently required.
although current data indicate that merscov does not appear to be as readily transmissible among humans, as was observed with the
sars-cov epidemic in 2003, continued risk assessment, surveillance, and vigilance by all countries are required.6 a high degree of clinical
awareness is required regarding the possibility
of mers-cov infection in patients with respiratory infections who have visited the middle east
in the preceding 10 days.
