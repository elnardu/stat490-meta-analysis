summary
background human infection with a novel coronavirus named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(mers-cov) was ﬁrst identiﬁed in saudi arabia and the middle east in september, 2012, with 44 laboratory-conﬁrmed
cases as of may 23, 2013. we report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of mers-cov disease,
after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a french hospital.
methods patient 1 visited dubai in april, 2013; patient 2 lives in france and did not travel abroad. both patients had
underlying immunosuppressive disorders. we tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower
(bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for mers-cov by
real-time rt-pcr targeting the upe and orf1a genes of mers-cov.


findings initial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.
respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation
and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). both patients developed acute renal failure. mers-cov was
detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [ct] values of 22·9 for upe and
24 for orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; ct values of 22·5 for upe and 23·9 for orf1a for an
induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.
the two patients shared the same room for 3 days. the incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second
case. no secondary transmission was documented in hospital staﬀ despite the absence of speciﬁc protective measures
before the diagnosis of mers-cov was suspected. patient 1 died on may 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.
interpretation patients with respiratory symptoms returning from the middle east or exposed to a conﬁrmed case
should be isolated and investigated for mers-cov with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed
incubation period of 12 days. immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.

introduction
coronaviruses are large enveloped single-stranded rna
viruses that can infect and cause disease in many animal
species, including bats, mice, birds, dogs, pigs, and cattle.1
in human beings, ﬁve respiratory coronaviruses have
been described, causing common cold (229e and oc43),
upper respiratory tract infections (nl63), or pneumonia
(hku1 and sars).2 in september, 2012, a novel human
coronavirus, named hcov-emc, was identiﬁed in two
patients with severe respiratory disease.3,4 this new
coronavirus belongs to lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus, and is genetically closely related to coronaviruses from various bat species in africa and eurasia.1,5,6
as of may 23, 2013, 44 laboratory-conﬁrmed cases had
been diagnosed in several countries (france, germany,
jordan, qatar, saudi arabia, tunisia, and the uk).7,8 most
patients with reported symptoms had severe respiratory
disease, some with acute renal failure, and the case fatality
rate is estimated at 50%.9 all cases originated from, or had


a history of travel to, the middle east, except for two
secondary cases in the uk,4,10 two in tunisia,8 and one in
france.11 a large cluster (>20) of cases has been documented in a hospital in saudi arabia, and another is
suspected on the basis of a retrospective analysis of
samples kept after an outbreak of respiratory diseases in a
jordanian hospital in april, 2012.12 on the basis of outbreak dynamics, hcov-emc was renamed middle east
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) by the
international committee on taxonomy of viruses.13
whereas an as yet unidentiﬁed animal reservoir might
have caused the initial outbreaks by introducing the virus
into the human population, the occurrence of clusters,
whether in the community or in hospitals, is a worrying
development, because it might result from adaptation of
the virus to inter-human transmission. this process of
adaptation might have been pivotal in the switch from
aborted outbreaks to the international pandemic of
sars-cov in 2003–04.14 we report detailed clinical and


virological information for two related cases of mers-cov
disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from
one patient to another in a french hospital in april, 2013.

methods
patients and genetic analysis
we report data for two patients who were admitted to
hospital in april and may, 2013, in northern france.
their medical records were compiled and reviewed by
their attending physicians. spouses provided written
informed consent for data and samples to be used for
research and reporting purposes.
we extracted rna from specimens from the upper
(nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar
lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and from whole
blood, plasma, and serum specimens using the
nucleospin dx virus or nucleospin rna blood mini
kits (macherey-nagel gmbh & co kg, düren, france)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for
sputum, we applied a pretreatment with proteinase k
(5 mg/ml for 10 min at 70°c) or digest-eur (eurobio,
coutaboeuf, france) to reduce viscosity. we included
sigma virus rna (10 ng per assay) as a control for the
extraction procedure and the absence of inhibitors.
we tested extracted nucleic acids by real-time rt-pcr
assays targeting the upe, orf1a, or orf1b regions of the
mers-cov genome as previously described15,16 on a
lightcycler 480 real-time pcr system (roche,
coutaboeuf, france). the quality of the specimens was

combining the sequences of the orf1a gene (from
nucleotide 11172 to nucleotide 11414) and the upe gene
(from nucleotide 27357 to nucleotide 27670) as the positive
strand, designed based on the ﬁrst published sequence of
mers-cov.5 we did conﬁrmatory sequence analysis on
the rdrp and n gene regions as described.15 we
assembled sequences using clc main workbench 6.8.3

results
patient 1, a 64-year-old man, visited dubai from april 9, to
april 17, 2013. fever and chills with diarrhoea
(three to four bowel movements per day) started on
april 22. symptoms were much the same as those of a
previous episode of sigmoiditis treated 6 months before.
he also had a history of hypertension and diabetes, and
had undergone renal transplantation in 1998, for renal
failure secondary to diabetes. his existing treatments
were mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone.
he was admitted to the valenciennes hospital on april 23,
presenting with diarrhoea and fever reaching 39°c,
arterial pressure at 137/66 mm hg, and pulseoxymetric
oxygen saturation of 96% on ambient air. at that time, he
did not have any respiratory symptoms (cough or
dyspnoea). chest radiograph was normal (not shown).
table 1 summarises biological data for patient 1. blood
cultures, stool analysis, urine antigen assays for
legionella spp and pneumococcus spp, and plasma pcr
for cytomegalovirus were negative. treatment with
ceftriaxone was initiated on april 24.
an abdominal ct scan done on april 24 did not show
any evidence of colitis, but lower thoracic images showed
major pulmonary inﬁltrates (ﬁgure 1a). on april 26, the
patient developed dyspnoea and cough. levoﬂoxacin was
added to ceftriaxone therapy. a ct scan of the lung was
done on april 26, and showed a mostly peripheral
interstitial inﬁltrate associated with right lower-lobe
consolidation and left lower-lobe consolidation in the
anterior basal, lateral basal, and posterior basal areas. a
bronchoalveolar lavage was done and cytology showed a
high number of neutrophils and macrophages. no
speciﬁc pathogen was identiﬁed on direct microbiological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid, and

co-trimoxazole was added to the antimicrobial treatment
regimen. oxygen requirement increased daily to
reach 10 l/min on april 29.
patient 1 was transferred to the douai hospital
intensive-care unit (icu) on april 29, where non-invasive
mechanical ventilation was started, and antimicrobial
therapy was modiﬁed to piperacilline plus tazobactam
and linezolid. he had rapid respiratory deterioration, and
was intubated on april 30 (ﬁgure 1b). respiratory failure
was followed by shock and renal failure, leading to
noradrenaline administration and continuous venovenous haemoﬁltration.
on may 1, on the basis of the clinical presentation and
the history of recent travel to dubai, the hypothesis of an
infection with mres-cov was raised, prompting the
transfer of nasopharyngeal and stored bronchoalveolar
lavage samples to the national reference center in paris.
further worsening of the respiratory status with a
partial pressure of oxygen (pao2) to fraction of inspired
oxygen (fio2) ratio of 100 despite low tidal volume and
high-positive end expiratory pressure (peep) ventilation,
inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, sedation, and
neuromuscular blockade, prompted the implementation
of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo).
persisting haemodynamic support with norepinephrine
at 0·5 mg/h was necessary. the patient was transferred to
the ecmo referral centre icu of lille university
teaching hospital on may 8 (ﬁgure 1c). as of may 27, the
patient remained under ecmo therapy because of
persisting severe acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ﬁgure 1d). at 100% fio2 on both ecmo and ventilator
settings and with mean ecmo pump ﬂow of 5·2 l/min,
resulting pao2 values did not exceed 80 mm hg. oxygen
sweep ﬂow was 12 l/min, resulting in mean partial
pressure of carbon dioxide values of about 38 mm hg.
the patient had several haemorrhagic complications,
contributing to renal failure and requirement for
extrarenal epuration. no evidence of bacterial superinfection was noted before ecmo. endotracheal aspirates
remained sterile. after the implantation of ecmo, the
patient had candidemia with candida albicans and
candida glabrata. empirical antifungal therapy with
caspofungin had been started before ecmo. patient 1
died on may 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.
patient 2, a 51-year-old man, was admitted to the
valenciennes hospital on april 26, for left arm deep
venous thrombosis. he lived in the north of france and
had not recently travelled abroad. his medical history
included myocardial infarction in 2005, arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and histamine-induced angioedema, for which he had needed systemic corticosteroid
therapy (prednisone 40 mg per day) since june, 2012. he
also had several episodes of deep venous thrombosis
associated with the presence of low concentrations of an
anticardiolipin antibody, igm isotype, for which he was
treated with a vitamin k antagonist. patient 2 shared
patient 1’s room from april 26, to april 29. the room was

20 m², and 1·5 m separated the two patients’ beds. both
patients shared the same bathroom. during this
3-day period, patient 1 remained mostly conﬁned to his
bed, whereas patient 2 was able to move around. no
nebulisers or known aerosol-generating procedures were
used for patient 1. because the diagnosis of mers-cov
2267

articles

infection was not suspected, patient 1 wore no mask, and
neither patient 2, nor staﬀ nor visitors used protective
equipment. patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to
his home on april 30.
on may 8, patient 2 presented with asthenia, myalgia,
and cough. on may 9, he was rapidly directed to the
infectious diseases department of lille university
teaching hospital, since by that time he was a known
contact of a conﬁrmed case (positive results for
mers-cov were available for patient 1 on may 7). on
admission, he presented with fever (38°c), pulseoxymetric
saturation of 95% on ambient air, and a respiratory rate
of 15 breaths per min.
table 2 summarises biological data for patient 2. chest
radiograph showed upper right lobe consolidation
(ﬁgure 2a). oxygen therapy at 3 l/min and piperacillin
plus tazobactam were started on april 30. the initial
nasopharyngeal sample was inconclusive. the patient
remained stable but with a high fever (39–40°c) between
may 9 and may 12. linezolid was added to the antimicrobial
regimen on may 11. diagnosis of mers-cov infection was
conﬁrmed on the basis of results from induced sputum
analysis on may 11. personal protective equipment—
an ffp2 mask, gloves, gown, and goggles—was used to
prevent secondary transmission during sputum induction.
on may 12, the patient had acute respiratory failure,
and oxygen therapy was increased to 5 l/min. chest
radiograph showed complete consolidation of the right
lung and involvement of the lower left lobe (ﬁgure 2b).

the patient was transferred to the icu where oxygen
therapy was progressively increased. appearance of confusion, disorientation, and increasing hypoxaemia led to
intubation and mechanical ventilation on may 13.
bronchoalveolar lavage was done, and no speciﬁc
pathogen was identiﬁed, either on direct microbiological
examination or culture. this sample was not tested for
mers-cov, because the diagnosis had already been
conﬁrmed. after intubation, on the same day, fio2 was
increased to 1; inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning became necessary. after intubation, dobutamine was
introduced for biventricular dysfunction—conﬁrmed
by transthoracic echocardiogram—and progressively
weaned over the next 48 h. acute renal failure and
anuria, despite volume expansion, resulted in haemodialysis on may 14. on may 14, pao2 to fio2 ratio was 90,
despite inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, and low
tidal volume and high peep ventilation, leading to
implementation of ecmo. neither norepinephrine nor
dobutamine treatment were underway on the day of
ecmo implantation. chest radiograph showed bilateral
diﬀuse alveolar-interstitial inﬁltrates on may 15
(ﬁgure 2c). the chest radiograph also showed bilateral
ground-glass opacities with major consolidation
(ﬁgure 2d). no bacterial superinfection was identiﬁed
before ecmo. patient 2’s respiratory status has
improved since may 26, with fio2 at 70% on both
ventilator and ecmo settings, ecmo ﬂow at 5·2 l/min,
and ecmo oxygen sweep ﬂow at 5 l/min. sedation is
being progressively weaned.
on may 2, the national inﬂuenza center at the institut
pasteur was notiﬁed by the french institute for public
health surveillance of a possible case of infection with

deemed negative (table 3). in view of the deterioration of
his respiratory status, the patient remained classiﬁed as a
possible case, awaiting the analysis of a bronchoalveolar
lavage specimen obtained on april 26. because of sample
transportation issues, this specimen was received on
may 7, and was shown to be positive by rt-pcr for both
the upe and orf1a targets with cycle threshold (ct) values
of 22·9 for upe and 24 for orf1a (table 3), thus conﬁrming
the case. parallel retesting of the april 30 nasopharyngeal
swab resulted in ct values of 37·2 for upe and 40 for
orf1a. a sputum sample obtained on may 7 was strongly
positive (ct <29) by rt-pcr for both targets, which
further conﬁrmed the diagnosis (table 3).
for patient 2, two nasal swabs obtained on may 9 both
showed ct values of about 37 at the detection limit of the
rt-pcr for the upe target but were negative for the
orf1a target, casting serious doubts on the possibility of
infection by the mers-cov. the diagnosis was subsequently conﬁrmed on the basis of the analysis by the
cellule d’intervention biologique d’urgence of an
induced sputum sample from may 11: rt-pcr analysis
showed ct values of 22·5 for upe, and 23·9 for orf1a
(table 3), and of 25·6 for orf1b. a nasopharyngeal swab
from the same day gave inconclusive results.
preliminary results of rt-pcr done on blood
specimens from patient 1 on may 9 were positive for
mers-cov in whole blood; weak but inconsistent
detection was noted in plasma samples (table 3). no
other types of specimens were analysed for either patient
in this timeframe.
virus isolation on vero e6 (african green monkey
kidney) cells was attempted from all respiratory
specimens from both patients and an isolate was
obtained from the sputum of patient 1. preliminary
analysis of serum samples from patient 1 from may 7 and
may 9 shows reactivity in western blot with a recombinant
n protein (data not shown).
conﬁrmatory sequence analysis of the rdrp and n gene
segments was done directly on rna extracted from the
bronchoalveolar lavage specimen from patient 1 and
sputum specimen from patient 2. the sequences from
both patients were identical. the rdrp sequences showed
the c→t polymorphism at position 15196, which distinguishes all available sequences from that of the emc/2012
isolate.5 for the n gene, sequences were identical to that of
the emc isolate and did not show the short deletion
(nucleotides 29736–29741) nor any of the polymorphisms
recorded at positions 29714 (a→t) and 29723 (g→t) in
the england/qatar/2012 sequence, nor that found at
position 29811 (c→t) in the jordan-n3/2012 sequence
(appendix).5,15,17 these results deﬁnitively establish that
both patients were infected with mers-cov.

discussion
this report describes the ﬁrst two french cases of
mers-cov infection with a case of patient-to-patient
nosocomial transmission (panel). our ﬁndings suggest

that the virus’s incubation period could reach 9–12 days,
a longer period than what was previously recorded, with
clinical implications for the duration of quarantine. our
results also suggest that the best samples to detect the
virus are those from the lower respiratory tract, rather
than nasopharyngeal samples.
the two cases we report show very similar clinical
features compared with the only two other cases for which
detailed clinical descriptions are available;3,4 other reports
do not have complete clinical data. initial presentation
included fever, chills, and myalgia. respiratory symptoms
with cough and dyspnoea soon became the predominant
clinical symptoms, with a rapid deterioration of oxygenation and increasing oxygen requirements, leading to
mechanical ventilation and ecmo. later in the course of
disease, and soon after icu admission, severe renal
failure with anuria needing renal replacement therapy
developed. lymphopenia was another common feature in
our two patients, also noted in the report by zaki and
colleagues.3 such a clinical presentation is reminiscent of
that of patients with severe sars, except that acute renal
failure seemed less common in sars cases. in fact,
sars-cov was associated with a wide spectrum of clinical
features—infected people presented initially with fever,
myalgia, chills, and rigor and subsequently developed
pneumonia.14,18 notably, patient 1 had diarrhoea among
initial symptoms, a feature not yet reported in patients
with mers-cov, but present upon admission in a quarter
of patients with sars.19 patient 1 died on may 28, and
patient 2 remains in the icu under ecmo. the casefatality rate in patients infected with mers-cov is high—
it is estimated to be 50% in the 44 patients reported so far
by who.8 this rate is higher than that of sars, estimated
at 15%, and strongly age-dependant.14 whether this rate
is higher for patients with mers-cov because of
panel: research in context
systematic review
we searched pubmed on may 25, 2013, with the terms
“hcov-emc” and “mers-cov” for articles published in
english. our search identiﬁed 24 reports linked to hcov-emc,
starting with the initial report from zaki and colleagues3
describing a previously unknown coronavirus isolated from
the sputum of a 60-year-old man. articles relevant to our
paper are cited in the text. the search with “mers-cov”
identiﬁed four articles, none of which were related to human
transmission or clinical ﬁndings.
interpretation
our report provides evidence that patients with respiratory
symptoms and a history of travel to the middle east or
contact with a known mers-cov case in the past 12 days
should be isolated and investigated using lower respiratory
tract samples. our ﬁndings also suggest that
immunosuppression is an aggravating factor, and could be
associated with atypical clinical presentation.

underreporting of milder forms of disease, a higher
proportion of patients with underlying immunosuppressive disorders, as in our patients, or higher virulence
of mers-cov compared with sars-cov has yet to
be established.
for the two patients described here, mers-cov was
detected at the time of the diagnosis of pneumonia.
the data we have obtained so far show identical
sequences for the viruses infecting both patients, and
this sequence is also identical to most of the available reported mers-cov sequences. whole genome
sequencing and analysis of viral population diversities
will be needed to further establish the degree of variability
of the viruses of the french cases relative to previous
cases and to work out the relatedness of the viruses of the
two patients upon transmission.
viral load was high in samples obtained from the lower
respiratory tract, whereas the virus was almost undetectable in upper respiratory tract samples. besides our two
cases, available data for conﬁrmed patients have shown
positive detection by rt-pcr in upper respiratory tract
specimens on days 4, 12, 13, and 144,10,20 after symptom
onset, and in lower respiratory tract specimens on days 8,
17, and 194,20 after symptom onset. a sputum sample
taken 7 days after symptom onset has also been reported
as having led to virus isolation.3 notably, for patient 2, as
for the london case reported in september, 2012, nasal
and throat swabs were negative at the time at which
sputum samples were positive.4
the little information available for virus shedding up
to now is reminiscent of sars-cov, for which overall
the virus was detected by rt-pcr in 76% of lower
respiratory tract clinical samples, versus 37% of upper
respiratory tract samples,21 and viral load was signiﬁcantly
2270

higher in the lower respiratory tract compared with the
upper respiratory tract. in the upper respiratory tract,
the rate of viral shedding was initially low and increased
to peak at around day 15.22 whether mers-cov is
present outside the respiratory tract will require
additional studies. so far, there have been no reports of
virus detection in stool or urine, and our preliminary
data suggest that the virus might be present in blood.
for sars, the virus was readily detected in stool samples
and more frequently after 10 days from onset of
symptoms, whereas in blood samples detection was
more frequent during the early course of illness.21
although additional data for the kinetics and routes of
viral shedding are needed for mers-cov, initial data
suggest that for possible or suspect cases, especially
when presenting early after the onset of symptoms,
clinical samples from the lower respiratory tract should
be obtained for conﬁrmation of infection. conﬁrmation
of an initially negative result on another sample taken a
few days later should be recommended before exclusion
of possible cases.
patient 2 was admitted on april 26, at a time when
pneumonia was already present in patient 1 and
mers-cov was present in the bronchoalveolar lavage
sample taken on the same day (although this result was
not available at the time). for the next 3 days, the two
patients shared the same room with no speciﬁc isolation
measures other than standard precautions. 9–12 days after
this exposure, patient 2 developed symptoms suggestive
of lower respiratory tract infection (ﬁgure 3). in patient 2,
infection with mers-cov was conﬁrmed 2 days later on
an induced sputum sample. this timeframe is at the high
end of the 1–9 day incubation period reported in the two
secondary cases from the uk10 and of the 2–10 day
incubation period of sars.23 in view of the very small
number of patients for whom a well-deﬁned window of
exposure for mers-cov is available, this ﬁnding of
human-to-human transmission through exposure during
the upper range of reported incubation periods suggests
that incubation periods beyond 10 days might be possible
with mers-cov, with important implications for the
duration of the quarantine needed to rule out infection in
contacts. furthermore, patient 2 had not recently travelled
abroad, excluding any other source of contamination.
however, the exact route of transmission from patient 1 to
patient 2 remains unclear. nosocomial transmission of
mers-cov has been suspected in patients and health-care
workers with respiratory symptoms in jordan in april,
2012, and in an ongoing hospital outbreak with more than
20 cases in saudi arabia.24 person-to-person transmission
was further documented from one patient to two family
members in the uk10 and for two cases reported in
tunisia.8 as for sars-cov, transmission through large
respiratory droplets is currently thought to be the most
likely route of mers-cov transmission between the two
patients we describe. no aerosol-generating procedures
were used with patient 1. the presence of diarrhoea in

patient 1, possibly linked to mers-cov infection as
previously described with sars-cov,25 might also have
been a potential source of contamination of the environment. systematic detection of mers-cov in stools of
future patients might be important to document shedding
of the virus through faeces and its potential contribution
to viral transmission. during the hospital stay in
valenciennes, no personal protective equipment was
used, and we did not record any secondary transmission
in more than 100 health-care workers assessed for the
development of symptoms or tested by rt-pcr for the
presence of mers-cov (unpublished). similarly, patient 2
was discharged from the hospital to his home and, up to
now, no secondary cases have been detected in some
40 contacts. low virus shedding in the upper respiratory
tract might contribute to reduced transmissibility,
although serological investigations will be needed to better
assess the extent of transmission. the underlying disorder
and immunosuppressive treatment of the two patients
probably contributed to their increased susceptibility to
the infection, and such background should be added to
the list of criteria associated with increased suspicion of
mers-cov infection. the risk that on acquisition of
mutations mers-cov might become increasingly
transmissible between human beings must also be kept in
mind and continuously assessed as suggested.26
