background middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (cov).
clinical data on mers-cov infections are scarce. we report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory
characteristics of 47 cases of mers-cov infections, identify knowledge gaps, and deﬁne research priorities.
methods we abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from conﬁrmed
cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated mers-cov infections reported from
saudi arabia between sept 1, 2012, and june 15, 2013. cases were conﬁrmed as having mers-cov by real-time rt-pcr.
findings 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-conﬁrmed mers-cov disease were identiﬁed; 36 (77%)
were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1). 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate. the case-fatality rate rose with increasing
age. only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical
disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal
disease (23 [49%]). common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]),
cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]). gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent,
including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]). all patients had abnormal
ﬁndings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. laboratory
analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven
[15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).
interpretation disease caused by mers-cov presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated
with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. major gaps in our knowledge of
the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent deﬁnition.

introduction
middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a new
human disease1 ﬁrst reported from saudi arabia in
september, 2012, after identiﬁcation of a novel
coronavirus (cov) from a male saudi arabian patient
who died from severe respiratory illness in june, 2012.1,2
the virus was initially designated hcov-emc,2 but after
global consensus it was renamed mers-cov.3 since the
ﬁrst reported saudi case of mers-cov, the saudi
ministry of health mandated that all patients with
respiratory illnesses needing admission to intensive care
should be tested for the virus, using any available clinical
specimen. all laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of mers-cov
to date from saudi arabia have been reported to who.4,5
data for clinical characteristics of mers are scant
because of the small number of cases detected since
appearance of the virus 15 months ago. clinical
information from individual or cluster case reports is
recorded by the program for monitoring emerging
diseases (promed) and is summarised through
updates6–10 from who, the us centers for disease
control and prevention (cdc), and the european centre

for disease prevention and control (ecdc). data
suggest that mers presents primarily with respiratory
symptoms and that most patients with serious disease
have either other medical comorbid disorders or
immunosuppression. case reports of family clusters and
hospital outbreaks in saudi arabia,11–13 and other
countries in the middle east and europe,14–20 also indicate
that individuals with mers-cov can present with a
range of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms, with
many manifestations of clinical disease. furthermore,
recent case reports from saudi arabia11–13, the uk,15,16
france,17 germany,18–20 italy,21 and tunisia22 suggest that
mild respiratory illness might be part of a wider clinical
spectrum of mers-cov infection. two patients from
tunisia9,22 and one from the uk16 had mild respiratory
illnesses and they did not need to be admitted.
furthermore, initial presentations of mers-cov disease
might not include respiratory symptoms initially.12,13 the
ﬁrst patient reported from france17 of mers-cov
infection presented initially with diarrhoea and
abdominal pain and subsequently developed respiratory
symptoms.

testing. a case was conﬁrmed as having infection if both
assays were positive. in case of discordance, or if the result
was judged a weak positive, another clinical sample was
requested and analysed by the ministry of health
laboratory. all patients had chest radiography. chest ct
was done in selected patients at the discretion of attending
doctors when clinically indicated.

we report demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of mers in patients diagnosed in saudi arabia
up to june 15, 2013. additional information is included
for 27 saudi cases reported previously by us.11–13

methods
data collection
we reviewed clinical records, nursing charts, laboratory
results, and imaging ﬁndings for all patients with
laboratory-conﬁrmed mers-cov infection who were
reported by the saudi ministry of health to who from
sept 1, 2012, to june 15, 2013. we obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and management outcome data and entered this information into
standardised data collection forms (prepared by ourselves
for this study). if data were missing from the records or
clariﬁcation was needed, we gathered data by direct
communication with attending doctors and other healthcare providers. we cross-checked the number of cases we
identiﬁed with samples reported as positive from the
saudi ministry of health regional reference virology
laboratory in jeddah. we obtained data for global merscov cases from promed, who, and cdc reports.

statistical analyses
we tabulated demographic, clinical, and laboratory
descriptive data. we did not do detailed statistical
analyses because of the self-selected nature of the cases.
we did univariate analyses of the association of sex or
increasing age with mortality, using binary logistic
regression analysis. we judged p<0·05 signiﬁcant.

results
47 cases of laboratory-conﬁrmed mers-cov disease
reported from saudi arabia between sept 1, 2012, and
june 15, 2013, were identiﬁed. all individuals except two
were saudi arabian citizens. identiﬁed cases of merscov included two clusters, one of three people in one
family living in one villa,12 which were reported in
october and november, 2012, and a hospital outbreak in
al-hasa13 of 23 cases in april and may, 2013. transfer of
patients and readmissions resulted in cases and
transmission in two health-care facilities. in the outbreak
at al-hasa,13 the median incubation period was 5·2 days,
with 95% of patients estimated to have symptom onset
within 12·4 days. the estimated serial interval was

procedures
attending doctors took dacron-ﬂocked nasopharyngeal
swabs from patients routinely and submitted these to the
ministry of health laboratory for initial screening of
mers-cov infection. attending doctors also obtained
deep respiratory samples (tracheal aspirates and
bronchoalveolar lavage) from patients admitted to
intensive-care units. clinical samples were screened at the
ministry of health laboratory with real-time rt-pcr.23,24
ampliﬁcation targeted both the upstream e protein
(upe gene) and orf1a for conﬁrmation, and these are
standard assays used in saudi arabia for mers-cov

7·6 days.13 table 1 shows the distribution over time of
mers-cov infections and deaths, from saudi arabia
and other countries.
table 2 shows the distribution of cases by sex and age,
and case-fatality rates. the male:female case ratio was
3·3:1. of 47 patients, 28 (60%) died, and the case-fatality
rate was similar between female and male patients
(55% vs 61%; odds ratio 1·31, 95% ci 0·34–5·12;
p=0·698). case-fatality rates rose with increasing age,
from 39% (seven of 18) in those younger than 50 years, to
48% (13 of 27) in the group aged under 60 years, and to
75% (15 of 20) in cases aged 60 years or older. univariate
analysis (by binary logistic regression) of age 60 years or
older as a risk factor for mortality was not signiﬁcant
(odds ratio 3·23, 95% ci 0·91–11·42; p=0·069).
the most common symptoms at presentation (table 3)
were fever, fever with chills or rigors, cough, shortness of
breath, and myalgia. gastrointestinal symptoms were
also frequent, including diarrhoea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain.
of 47 patients, 42 (89%) needed intensive care and
34 (72%) had mechanical ventilation. the median time to
mechanical ventilation was 7 days (range 3–11) and
median time to death was 14 days (range 5–36).
most patients received oseltamivir and broad-spectrum
antibiotics, which covered community-acquired and
atypical pneumonia. five individuals were also empirically
started on ﬂuconazole, two received steroids, ﬁve were
treated with ribavirin, one was given interferon alfa, and
ﬁve were infused with intravenous immunoglobulin.
45 (96%) of 47 patients had underlying comorbid
medical disorders and only two people were previously
healthy (table 4). diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic
cardiac disease, and hypertension were the most frequent
comorbid disorders. one patient was on long-term
immunosuppressive treatment with steroids. the
number of comorbidities in relation to mortality is
shown in table 5.
all 47 patients had mers-cov infection conﬁrmed
by real-time rt-pcr testing, which was done by
measuring cycle threshold (ct) values for viral load.
ct data were available from 37 samples, and these
ranged from 19·85 to more than 40, the limit of
detection (appendix). the time between onset of

symptoms and obtaining clinical samples varied.
during the health-care-associated outbreak at
al-hasa,13 most patients were sampled within 72 h of
onset. for sporadic cases and family case clusters,
intervals were longer (average 6 days).
haematological abnormalities seen on admission
were thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]), lymphopenia
(16 [34%]), and lymphocytosis (ﬁve [11%]). 43 (91%)
patients had normal neutrophil counts on admission,
and monocyte counts were also normal. concentrations
of lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase,
and aspartate aminotransferase were raised in
23 (49%), ﬁve (11%), and seven (15%) patients,
respectively. other liver-function test values were
within the normal range.
none of the 47 blood cultures or respiratory-tract
samples screened for bacterial, viral, or fungal
pathogens on admission was positive. no cases of
co-infection with mers-cov were recorded. microbiological investigations excluded bacterial pathogens
associated with community-acquired pneumonia.
abnormalities on chest radiography were noted in all
47 cases. imaging ﬁndings ranged from minor to
extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities and
included increased bronchovascular markings, airspace
opacities, patchy inﬁltrates, interstitial changes, patchy
to conﬂuent air-space consolidation, nodular opacities,

discussion
as of july 21, 2013, 90 laboratory-conﬁrmed cases of
mers have been reported worldwide to who, including
45 deaths (table 1).25 the ﬁrst two known patients with
mers-cov infection (diagnosed retrospectively) died in
april, 2012, at a public hospital in zarqa, jordan.14 all
individuals with mers have been linked directly or
indirectly to one of four countries in the middle east—
namely saudi arabia, jordan, qatar, and the united arab
emirates. the largest number of mers-cov cases has
been reported from saudi arabia, where 70 cases are
known to date. countries outside saudi arabia—
reporting a total of 20 patients with mers—are jordan,14
the uk,15,16 italy,21 germany,19 france,17,18 tunisia,22 qatar,
and united arab emirates (table 1). some cases of merscov infection have been reported in travellers returning
from the middle east and in their close contacts (some
without a travel history),16,17 suggesting person-to-person
transmission. this type of transmission was conﬁrmed
by genome sequencing of mers-cov isolates from the
al-hasa health-care-associated outbreak.13

in saudi arabia, the ﬁrst case of mers-cov infection
occurred in june, 2012 (reported in september, 2012). two
main reporting periods subsequently became apparent.
the ﬁrst was the early period from june, 2012, until
april 1, 2013, during which time nine cases were recorded
in residents of central and western saudi arabia (bishah,
al qassim, and riyadh; ﬁgure 2). these cases were
predominantly male (90%), occurred sporadically, and
included two small family clusters in riyadh. in one
family cluster,12 the index case resided in an extended
household of 28 males and females, including 18 children.
secondary cases arose in two sons, and a grandson also
became infected. during this ﬁrst reporting period, no ill
health was identiﬁed or reported among health-care
workers; thus, transmission potential of mers-cov in the
community seems low. in the second period, from april 1,
2013, to july 14, 2013, almost all cases arose in the eastern
province of saudi arabia (al-hasa) and were associated
mainly with transmission in hospitals, including three
cases among family contacts and two cases in health-care
workers.13 the rise in the number of mers-cov cases
detected in saudi arabia during the second reporting
period might not reﬂect increased transmission but rather
could be attributable to augmented case detection as a
result of enhanced screening and surveillance activities.
dissemination of information on mers-cov by the saudi
ministry of health has raised awareness among healthcare providers and the public, leading to an increase in
reports of suspected mers-cov cases, from 168 in april,
756

2013, to 524 in may, 2013 (currently about 70 reports daily,
on average).
transfer of patients and readmissions, in addition to
sporadic community introductions, led to transmission
of mers-cov between patients at four health-care
facilities.13 the outbreak at al-hasa was brought under
control quickly with infection-control measures.13
in the uk, mers-cov was transmitted to a family
member who visited a patient with conﬁrmed infection,16
and a recent report from france described patient-topatient nosocomial transmission of mers-cov.17 in that
case, a 64-year-old french man with a renal transplant
fell ill with diarrhoea and fever on april 22, 2013, a week
after returning from dubai. pneumonia was an
incidental ﬁnding on chest radiography and he
subsequently developed severe respiratory disease, from
which he died. a second case of mers-cov infection
was diagnosed subsequently at the same hospital in a
patient on long-term steroid treatment. the respiratory
presentation of the index case suggests transmission in
the hospital room shared by both patients. however,
infectiousness of faeces (because the index case
presented with diarrhoea) at an early stage due to crosscontamination cannot be ruled out.
our study design has several limitations that do not
allow for more detailed statistical analyses. first, patients
were self-selected because of referral to hospital and being
screened actively for mers-cov by nature of their serious
clinical condition. second, we did a retrospective study of
clinical case records. third, case record entry was not
done uniformly. fourth, comorbidity data were unavailable
for admissions without mers-cov infection and from
the community population. finally, follow-up data after
discharge were missing. despite these limitations, we
have been able to delineate further the epidemiological,
demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 saudi
patients with mers-cov infection. the main ﬁndings of
our study are that most patients present with serious
respiratory disease, need to be admitted to hospital, and
60% of them die. adults of both sexes are aﬀected, at a
mean age of 56 years (range 14–94). a quarter of patients
had accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, including
diarrhoea and vomiting, and many cases occurred in
individuals with chronic underlying comorbid medical
disorders. half of all patients had two medical
comorbidities: diabetes and chronic renal disease. a study
from saudi arabia showed that more than 50% of saudi
people older than 50 years have diabetes.26 however, the
large number of people with mers-cov infection and
chronic renal disease might have been biased by the
al-hasa hospital outbreak, which happened in the renal
unit. further case-control studies are needed to deﬁne the
eﬀect of comorbidities on susceptibility to, and associated
mortality from, mers-cov infection.
who’s case deﬁnition for mers-cov, which was used
by the saudi ministry of health for screening,5,6 includes
fever of higher than 38°c, thus self-selecting patients

who are clinically ill. this classiﬁcation precludes
identiﬁcation of the full range of clinical presentations
and misses asymptomatic, subclinical, and mild cases.
furthermore, since the ﬁrst case report from saudi
arabia, in september, 2012, the ministry of health has
recommended mandatory testing for mers-cov of all
cases of respiratory illness requiring admission to
intensive care. this directive has biased selection and
detection of more severe cases of mers-cov infection
and might have skewed the observed high case-fatality
rates. clinical symptoms, laboratory investigations, and
imaging ﬁndings of mers-cov are similar to those
noted in other community-acquired respiratory-tract
infections. for example, imaging features of mers
generally resemble those seen in patients with
community-acquired pneumonia. progression from
unilateral focal air-space opacities to multifocal or
bilateral involvement was frequent in patients admitted
to the intensive-care unit with mers pneumonia. the
radiographic appearance of mers lung disease shares
common features with pneumonia of other causes.
clusters of mers-cov infection within families indicate
that a range of clinical illness occurs. reports from tunisia22
and the united arab emirates of infections in siblings
whose father’s illness was a probable case of mers-cov
infection, and the case report from the uk,16 show that
siblings who are not immunocompromised manifest only
mild respiratory illness and do not need admission. in the
uk family cluster,16 of 33 close contacts (20 household and
13 non-household), only two cases of mers-cov infection
were conﬁrmed (6% attack rate); one individual had mild
illness and the other had severe illness. importantly, no
cases of mers-cov infection were reported in 59 healthcare workers who were in contact with the index case
without wearing full personal protective equipment.
recent discussions have focused on similarities of
clinical and laboratory features between mers-cov
and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus
(sars-cov) infections.27–34 sars originated in southern
china in november, 2002, spread to hong kong, and
was transmitted rapidly worldwide, resulting in
8422 cases and 916 deaths (case-fatality rate 11%). on
the basis of our ﬁndings, the clinical features of merscov disease bear some resemblance to those seen in
patients with disease caused by sars-cov. in patients
with mers, fever, cough, and dyspnoea are the major
symptoms in those admitted to hospital. other common
presenting symptoms include chills, rigor, headache,
myalgia, and malaise. although respiratory failure is a
major clinical feature, mild disease and atypical
presentation with diarrhoea have been reported in
cases of mers and sars. common laboratory features
of sars32–34 recorded on admission include inﬁltrates
on chest radiographs and lymphopenia, whereas
thrombocytopenia and raised amounts of lactate
dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase have
been noted in some cases. although our data show

similarities in clinical presentation between cases of
mers and sars, some important diﬀerences are also
present (table 6).

scenario and 0·60 in a more optimistic scenario. these
researchers concluded that mers-cov does not yet have
pandemic potential, which would occur if r0 reached 1.
breban and colleagues’ analysis shows that the chance of
mers-cov having an r0 greater than 1 is very small.
data to assess any changes in incidence of admissions or
mortality due to pneumonia are not available in the
who eastern mediterranean region. overall, as yet,
evidence is scant throughout this who region to support
the possibility of either transmission of mers-cov from
asymptomatic infected individuals or ongoing, low
prevalence, mildly symptomatic illness in the community.
reducing the rate of introduction of mers-cov into
human beings is unpredictable because the source of the
virus is not yet known. we are searching vigorously for
the source of mers-cov in animal hosts and other
potential reservoirs and for transmission routes to
individuals. active surveillance, achieving early detection,
rapid diagnosis, and isolation of mers cases has been in
place in saudi arabia to achieve early control of the virus.
the likelihood that mers will follow a path similar to
that of sars remains unlikely. the virus has been
circulating for 15 months without reaching a form
capable of causing a pandemic. proactive surveillance for
severe acute respiratory illness caused by mers-cov is
ongoing across saudi arabia. as of july 14, 2013, more
than 3000 respiratory-tract samples had been tested for
the presence of mers-cov at the saudi ministry of
health reference laboratory in jeddah. who’s deﬁnition
of a probable case of mers-cov infection5 includes
individuals with severe acute respiratory illness with no
known cause and with an epidemiological link to a
conﬁrmed case. until the transmission characteristics of
mers-cov are better understood,34 patients under
investigation, and probable and conﬁrmed cases of
infection, should be managed in health-care facilities
with standard contact and droplets precautions. as
information becomes available, these recommendations
will be re-evaluated and updated as needed.
long-term sequelae of patients who recover from acute
mers are not yet known and need to be deﬁned. clinical
follow-up of patients who recovered from sars shows
radiological, functional, and psychological abnormalities
of varying degrees.38 in the early rehabilitation phase,
many patients complained of limitations in physical
function from general weakness or shortness of breath.
lung function testing 6–8 weeks after hospital discharge
showed a mild or moderate restrictive pattern consistent
with muscle weakness in 6–20% of individuals.
psychobehavioural problems such as anxiety and
depression were not uncommon in the early recovery
phase and improved over time for most patients.
our study was not designed to ascertain prognostic
predictive values. the ability of clinical, laboratory, and
other features to distinguish mers-cov from other
respiratory-tract infections will need appropriately
controlled studies with large numbers of patients. in the

panel 2: research in context
systematic review
we abstracted and analysed available demographic, clinical,
and laboratory data from conﬁrmed cases of mers-cov
infection (available at the ministry of health, riyadh,
saudi arabia), which were reported by the saudi ministry of
health to who, between june 1, 2012, and june 15, 2013.
we searched pubmed and promed websites on june 15, 2013,
for all relevant english language publications with the terms
“mers-cov”, “novel coronavirus”, “middle east”, and
“hcov-emc”. we included all reports from saudi arabia.2,11–13
data for mers-cov infections from other countries (reported
on promed, in cdc reports, by the european centre for
disease prevention and control and by the uk’s health
protection agency [now public health england], and in
pubmed) were also reviewed.
interpretation
in our previous reports of 27 cases from saudi arabia we
presented selected limited data on patients’ demographics,
symptoms before presentation, comorbidities, and
laboratory data. we now show in a series of 47 cases,
including the previous 27, more detailed analysis of patients’
demographics, age range and sex-related prevalence and
mortality, full range of symptoms and comorbidities at
presentation, and the number of comorbidities related to
mortality. scant information is available about the
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of mers-cov
infections, and limited data come from individual, family,
and hospital case reports. we present the largest case series
to date of mers-cov infections and provide further
information on demographic, clinical, epidemiological, and
laboratory features of patients. in individuals admitted with
medical comorbidities of mers, a wide range of clinical
manifestations can be seen, and they are associated with
substantial mortality. we have identiﬁed major knowledge
gaps in the source, community prevalence, clinical spectrum,
laboratory features, and epidemiology of mers-cov
infections. further deﬁnition of the clinical and
epidemiological range of mers in the community is a priority
and needs multidisciplinary research.

sars epidemic, all laboratory variables (apart from
absolute neutrophil counts) distinguished sars poorly
from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia.
the comparatively few cases of mers-cov disease
identiﬁed to date restricts the certainty of any comparison
of epidemiological, demographic, and clinical features.
our study brings to light major knowledge gaps and a
range of unanswered questions on the epidemiology,
natural history, clinical presentation, course of disease,
optimum management, and eventual control of
mers-cov infection (panel 1). the source of infection,
predisposing factors for susceptibility, and predictive
factors for poor outcome remain unknown and need
further investigation. case-control and community

studies are also needed to deﬁne accurately the clinical
range of disease caused by mers-cov. early recognition
and rapid initiation of infection-control precautions are
currently the most important strategies for controlling
nosocomial mers-cov infections. at the moment, no
tests are available to rule out mers among patients with
febrile respiratory illnesses, and development of a range
of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests is needed urgently.39
with availability of improved laboratory methods,40
important questions about transmission, risk factors,
clinical course, and natural history of mers-cov
infection need to be addressed at once (panel 2).
although current data on mers-cov infections are
biased by high case fatality in admitted patients with
medical comorbidities, since june 15, 2013, the saudi
ministry of health has further reported mers-cov
infections in 14 asymptomatic individuals (three
children <15 years, seven health-care workers, and four
family members) after screening contacts of conﬁrmed
mers-cov cases. two further asymptomatic cases have
been recorded among female health-care workers in the
eastern region and al-hasa. these ﬁndings are
important because the cases we present here might be
just the tip of an iceberg of a range of clinical illness
caused by mers-cov. apart from enhanced and active
surveillance for cases, we need to develop rapid,
accurate, serological diagnostic tests for case-control
studies.
