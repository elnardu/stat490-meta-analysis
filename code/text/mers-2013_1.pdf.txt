summary
background the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) is an emerging virus involved in cases
and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the arabian peninsula, tunisia, morocco, france, italy,
germany, and the uk. we provide a full description of a fatal case of mers-cov infection and associated
phylogenetic analyses.
methods we report data for a patient who was admitted to the klinikum schwabing (munich, germany) for severe
acute respiratory infection. we did diagnostic rt-pcr and indirect immunoﬂuorescence. from time of diagnosis,
respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantiﬁcation. we constructed a maximum likelihood
tree of the ﬁve available complete mers-cov genomes.
findings a 73-year-old man from abu dhabi, united arab emirates, was transferred to klinikum schwabing on
march 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness. he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several
lines of treatment. the patient died on day 18, due to septic shock. mers-cov was detected in two samples of
bronchoalveolar ﬂuid. viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2 × 10⁶ copies
per ml). maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 rna copies per ml on day 13; the virus was not
present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with
up to 1031 rna copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). one of two oronasal swabs obtained on
day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral rna (5370 copies per ml). no virus was detected in blood. the full virus
genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny,
correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. the time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011.
addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in essen, germany, showed a
clustering of viruses derived from qatar and the united arab emirates.
interpretation we have provided the ﬁrst complete viral load proﬁle in a case of mers-cov infection. mers-cov
might have shedding patterns that are diﬀerent from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need
alternative diagnostic approaches.

introduction
in june, 2012, a coronavirus belonging to a group of
viruses that had previously only been detected in bats was
cultured from respiratory secretions of a patient who had
died from severe acute respiratory infection.1 the same
agent was retrospectively detected in clinical samples
from a hospital outbreak of severe acute respiratory
infection that occurred in jordan in april, 2012, marking
the ﬁrst known occurrence of the virus in people.2 the
agent has been named middle east respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (mers-cov).3 as of june 10, 2013,
55 laboratory-conﬁrmed cases had been reported in
jordan, saudi arabia, the uk, france, italy, germany, and
tunisia.3 31 individuals with laboratory-conﬁrmed
infection had died. few virological data have become
available for mers-cov cases, and there is no information
about the viral genome sequence, which could identify
important epidemiological characteristics.4–6

here, we provide a full description of a fatal case of
mers-cov infection imported to munich, germany,
from abu dhabi, including a chronological proﬁle of
virus concentrations in diverse body compartments.
we fully sequenced the mers-cov genome, and
therefore could do a chronologically calibrated
phylogenetic analysis with all available mers-cov
genome sequences. these data were complemented by
novel sequence data from an unlinked case treated in
germany in 2012.7,8

treatment contract.
we did diagnostic rt-pcr and indirect immunoﬂuorescence, following who recommendations.7,9 for
serum neutralisation tests, we grew vero b4 cells to
subconﬂuence in 24-well plates. pre-incubation reactions
contained 25 plaque-forming units of mers-cov (emc
strain) in 100 μl of medium, mixed one-to-one with
serum samples from the patient prediluted in medium.
the starting dilution was a tenth. after 1 h incubation at
37°c, each well was infected for 1 h at 37°c with the total
200 μl pre-incubation reaction. supernatants were
removed and overlaid with avicell resin as described by
herzog and colleagues.10 assays were terminated and
stained after 3 days. we deﬁned neutralisation titres as
the serum dilution reducing the number of plaques in
four parallel wells in summary by greater than 90%.
antibodies were tested by immunoﬂuorescence assay.7
all clinical materials stored in the ward and laboratories
were gathered and submitted for virological diagnostic
tests. from the time of laboratory diagnosis, respiratory,
faecal, and urine samples were obtained. we designed
two diﬀerent sets of primers generating overlapping
amplicons (available on request). the ﬁrst set consisted
of 70 amplicons, 386–800 bp in length, with all primers
containing two strong watson-crick bps at their 3 ends,
so as to bind the template with high aﬃnity. the second
set consisted of 68 amplicons, 415–761 bp in length, with
primers that had no more than two strong bps in their
ﬁve 3 terminal nucleotides and no strong pairings in
the two 3 positions. this method of primer design can
decrease sensitivity, but it prevents mispriming within
the product, which can improve the success of

ampliﬁcation. after rt-pcr, we sequenced all fragments
on a roche 454 junior instrument (roche, penzberg,
germany) and assembled in geneious (version 6.1.2).
virus quantiﬁcation was done with standard calibration
curves that were based on quantiﬁed in-vitro transcribed
rna for the upe target gene.9
we constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the ﬁve
available complete mers-cov genomes with phyml11
and the gtr+gamma model of molecular evolution;
we assessed phylogenetic support with 1000 bootstrap
replicates. we inferred a timescale by linear regression
of genetic divergence from the root against time of
collection of the samples. the root was placed such that
the correlation coeﬃcient was maximised. a
phylogenetic tree based on all available mers-cov
sequences was calculated with phyml11 on a
concatenated 4012 bp dataset with the hky substitution
model. reduction of the dataset was determined by the
small number of sequence fragments that could be
retrieved from a stored clinical sample containing a
small amount of the virus, derived from a patient treated
in essen, germany.

results
on march 8 (day 0), the patient—a 73-year-old man
from abu dhabi, united arab emirates—abruptly
developed ﬂu-like symptoms, with fever and
non-productive cough. he was admitted to mafraq
hospital (abu dhabi) on day 2 (ﬁgure 1), and was
diagnosed with pneumonia. he was intubated on day 9
because of progressive hypoxia and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (fraction of inspired oxygen 60%;
positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm h2o). the
patient had received intensive antimicrobial treatment
with
meropenem,
levoﬂoxacin,
vancomycin,
caspofungin, aciclovir, and oseltamivir during his stay
in an intensive care unit in abu dhabi, without major
improvement in his pulmonary function. the patient
was transferred to klinikum schwabing (munich,
germany) on march 19, 2013 (ﬁgure 1).
the patient had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma
in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment in
the previous few years, such as high-dose chemotherapy
with autologous stem-cell transplantation in 2009. at
relapse of his multiple myeloma in november, 2012, he
was given lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. relatives
reported that the patient owned camels, and had taken
care of a diseased animal shortly before onset of
symptoms. no animal samples, or further details about
potential sources or exposures could be retrieved.

during his stay in munich, we recorded
thrombocytopenia (table 1). thrombocytopenia was also
reported in the ﬁrst described case of mers-cov
infection,1 in two of four patients from a family cluster in
saudi arabia,12 and in the two cases reported from
france.5
the patient developed renal insuﬃciency on day 14,
and required dialysis. despite continuous invasive
ventilation and antibiotic treatment, the patient’s health
status deteriorated. death occurred on day 18 and was
due to septic shock, with signs of haemolysis and acute
coagulation disorder (ﬁgure 1, table 1).
after hospital admission in munich, infection with
mers-cov was suspected on the basis of
treatment-refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome,
combined with the geographical origin of the patient.
bronchoalveolar ﬂuid was obtained on march 20
and 22 (days 12 and 14). mers-cov was detected in both
samples by rt-pcr. we also detected herpes simplex
virus type 1 dna13 (6·4 × 10⁴ to 1·9 × 10⁷ copies per ml)
and rhinovirus rna14 (3·7 × 10⁵ to 2·1 × 10⁹ copies per ml)
by (rt-)pcr in both samples.
mers-cov rna concentrations in respiratory samples
ranged from 933 to 1·2 × 10⁶ genome copies per ml. virus
concentrations seemed to be higher in samples taken
earlier in the course than in those obtained later (ﬁgure 2).
concentrations were more variable in tracheobronchial
samples than in bronchoalveolar lavage samples
(ﬁgure 2), which was ascribed to variation in volumes of
saline solution applied during removal of tracheobronchial
samples. notably, suction catheters without opening at
point of care and stored for as long as 5 days at 8°c in a
refrigerator in the intensive care unit tested consistently
positive but yielded up to roughly 3·5log10 lower rna
concentrations than did those in fresh tracheobronchial
aspirates taken on the same days (ﬁgure 2).
immunoﬂuorescence assays yielded endpoint titres on
day 16 of infection (table 2). an igm-speciﬁc immunoﬂuorescence assay conﬁrmed recent infection in the
same serum sample (table 2). plaque-reduction
neutralisation test conﬁrmed mers-cov speciﬁcity of
detected antibody titres (table 2). these titres were
somewhat lower than those recorded for serum samples
from an unlinked non-fatal case of mers-cov treated in
germany in 2012.8 serum samples from this patient had
been taken later than they were for our patient (table 2).
we tested two urine samples on day 12, one on day 13,
and one on day 16. one of the two samples on day 12, and
the sample from day 13 were positive, meaning that the
virus was not present in urine after renal failure (day 14),
with a maximum virus concentration of 2691 rna
copies per ml on day 13. both stool samples obtained on
day 12 and the ﬁve on day 16 were positive, with up to
1031 rna copies per g, which is a concentration close to
the lowest detection limit of the assay. we recorded a low
virus concentration in one of two oronasal aspirate
samples taken from the intubated patient on day 16

we sequenced the full mers-cov genome directly from
respiratory samples (genbank accession number
kf192507). we subjected all available mers-cov genome
sequences to phylogenetic analysis, including a correlation
and regression analysis of known dates of virus isolation
versus tree branch lengths (ﬁgure 3). we estimated the
rate of evolution as 1·6 × 10–³ substitutions per site per
year. the time of the common ancestor of all ﬁve viruses
for which genomes are available was halfway through 2011
(ﬁgure 3). the virus in our patient clustered with a
sequence from a virus imported into the uk from qatar.16
to compare this sequence with that of another virus from
the same region, we reanalysed a stored clinical sample
from another case of mers-cov infection imported into
germany in october, 2012. this sample contained low
concentrations of rna, so the genome of the virus had
not been successfully sequenced previously.8 after many
attempts to recover rt-pcr fragments from the available
bronchoalveolar lavage sample, we could sequence 12

fragments, covering 4012 nucleotides of the mers-cov
genome (genbank accession number kc875821). a
concatenated alignment of homologous sequence
portions of all available mers-cov sequences was
subjected to phylogenetic analyses, conﬁrming a
clustering of sequences from qatar and the united arab
emirates (ﬁgure 3). a sequence from a patient with a
history of travel to pakistan and saudi arabia branched
next to this cluster.
during and up to 10 days after the course of treatment,
14 health-care workers who had direct contact with our
patient or patient-derived materials reported mild
respiratory symptoms. samples were taken from the
upper respiratory tract and tested by two diﬀerent
rt-pcr assays for mers-cov. none yielded positive
results. by contrast, one patient who had had direct
contact with the patient with mers-cov was infected
with hcov-nl63, a common human coronavirus, and
four patients were infected with rhinoviruses. these
rhinoviruses were not all mutually related, and none was
related to the rhinovirus detected in the patient with
mers-cov (appendix). follow-up of all contact patients,
including investigation for subclinical infections, is in
progress.

discussion
we have outlined the chronological follow-up of a patient
with mers-cov, in which we used quantitative virological
diagnostic tests (panel). viral loads were highest in the
lower-respiratory tract. the viral sequence from this
patient clustered with sequences from nearby qatar.
laboratory data are crucial for diagnostic

prognosis, and to estimate infection risks. without
quantitative laboratory data from well documented
cases of mers-cov infection, most considerations had
been made on the basis of an assumed analogy to
severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars).12,18–20
however, elementary traits of the virus, such as its
receptor usage and sensitivity to type i and type iii
interferon, diﬀer substantially from that of the sars
coronavirus, suggesting that diﬀerences in disease
patterns (eg, in organ tropism or in virus shedding)
might exist.21–25 we focused on these aspects with
quantitative virus testing in all relevant body
compartments, including viral loads in non-respiratory
samples.5,12 however, our patient—like most other cases
anecdotally reported so far—had an underlying disease
that could aﬀect virus shedding patterns. only analysis
of a large number of patients can yield general ﬁgures
about qualitative virus data.
faecal shedding was of particular interest, because
patients with sars regularly showed high virus
concentrations and prolonged virus excretion in stools
that led to the use of stool samples, even for routine
sars diagnostic tests.18,20,26 diarrhoea was reported in
two descriptions of mers-cov clusters, and it was
speculated that faecal virus shedding might have
occurred.5,12 however, no laboratory data for virus in
stool samples were provided. our patient had low faecal
virus concentrations that were close to the lowest
detection limit on days 12 and 16 of illness. in the only
other description so far, one stool sample from a patient
with mers-cov had a negative result.16 stool samples
from many patients, including those with early stages of
disease, should be tested to assess whether faecal
sources could have a role in transmission, or whether
mers-cov diﬀers from sars in this aspect.
another important ﬁnding was that we recorded low
concentrations of virus in urine samples. this ﬁnding
is surprising, because early kidney failure during the
course of mers-cov infection has been reported, and
kidney cells in laboratory models are highly permissive
for mers-cov replication.5,12,23 the fact that the virus
was present in urine but not in the blood suggests
autonomous virus replication in the kidneys, potentially
without active secretion of virus into the urine.
however, renal failure due to speciﬁc viral infection or
immunopathogenesis is not necessarily indicated,
because the patient had received several doses of
potentially nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents in a setting
of underlying multiple myeloma. post-mortem
examinations are urgently needed to clarify whether
kidney failure in mers-cov infection is a primary and
preventable result of viral infection, or a secondary
complication of severe systemic disease.27,28
quantitative virus data are needed to orient
diagnostics and hospital infection control measures.

concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage and

panel: research in context
systematic review
we searched pubmed for reports published in english at any
time before june 7, 2013. we used the search term “merscov or hcov-emc”. we identiﬁed 29 reports linked to
middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov),
starting with zaki and colleagues’ initial report,1 in which a
previously unknown coronavirus isolated from the sputum of
a 60-year-old man is described. when we used the search
term “mers-cov”, we identiﬁed four reports,2,5,12,17 none of
which provided quantitative viral load proﬁles of infected
patients.
interpretation
our report provides the ﬁrst complete viral load proﬁle in a
case of mers-cov infection. the distribution of viral loads in
the respiratory tract suggests lower-respiratory-tract samples
should be taken preferentially. low concentrations of the
virus in stool, urine, and blood samples suggests little virus
excretion—at least in our patient—from body compartments
other than the respiratory tract.

tracheobronchial aspirates, conﬁrms suggestions made
in another report about the preferential use of
lower-respiratory-tract samples for virus diagnostic
tests.5 notably, the reported overall stability of detectable
virus rna in closed suction catheters indicates a
straightforward and non-contagious way to collect
diagnostic samples even from non-intubated patients.
oronasal swabs should not be preferentially submitted
for testing, especially in patients presenting late in their
disease course with substantial lower respiratory
involvement.5
our data for stool, urine, and blood samples suggest a
fairly low infection risk during non-respiratory care
procedures. the absence of detectable virus in blood
matches reports made in an earlier case of mers-cov
infection.16 however, guery and colleagues5 reported
low semi-quantitative virus measurements in the blood
of one of their patients. moreover, initial experimental
studies suggested that mers-cov infected vascular
endothelial cells.25 however, quantitative data suggest a
low risk from general laboratory procedures involving
blood.
by contrast, the low virus concentrations and failure
to isolate infectious virus from respiratory secretions
should not be taken as a general indication of
airway-associated
infection
risks.
virological
monitoring of the patient started only late in the disease
course, at a time when the infectiousness of the virus
could already have been reduced (as suggested by the
occurrence of neutralising antibodies). the fact that we
could not isolate mers-cov could have been due to the
concomitant presence of herpes simplex virus type 1,
which overgrew some of the diagnostic cell cultures.
749

articles

furthermore, coronaviruses that infect people are
generally diﬃcult to isolate, particularly in late phases
of disease. only two successful isolations of mers-cov
have been reported worldwide so far.1,5 these isolations
were done on day 4 of disease,5 and day 7 of disease.1
our samples were taken on days 12 and 14, and the
sample from day 12 was stored for 3 days before cell
culture. isolation success cannot provide any
information about infectiousness of the patient. even a
highly concentrated rhinovirus does not seem to have
been transmitted from the patient, suggesting that
eﬀective protective measures were in place during
treatment of the intubated patient in the intensive
care unit.
the sequence data from this and another patient
treated in germany enable an extended analysis of
phylogeny, hinting at a geographical structure of the
mers-cov tree. speciﬁcally, viral sequences from the
eastern part of the arabian peninsula cluster together
and stem from one common ancestor whose date of
existence is projected to be after that of viruses from
jeddah and jordan. date estimates will probably be
reﬁned when more sequences become available.
moreover, whether the reported geographical structure
represents repeated transfer from a geographically
structured viral reservoir population and limiting
chains of person-to-person transmission or multiple
sustained lineages of human infections is unclear. with
only ﬁve complete genome sequences available as yet,
genetic data are urgently needed to establish the spatial
and temporal distribution of cases, estimate the
number of independent human chains of transmission,
and thus better assess the threat that mers-cov poses
to world health. four sequences from a continuing
hospital outbreak in al-hasa, saudi arabia, have now
been deposited in genbank. preliminary phylogenetic
analyses conﬁrm the clustering of viruses from the
eastern part of the arabian peninsula (qatar: strains
england2 and essen; abu dhabi: strain munich; alhasa: genbank accession numbers kf186564kf186567).
